# NLP Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that I made to learn. The NLP Preprocessing involves basic text corpus extraction from wikipedia, basic data cleaning, tokenization, morphological analysis - using FST - that reduces repeated digits to single digit, Language models and smoothening, and just a mini implementation of minimum edit distance using the levinshtien package.
