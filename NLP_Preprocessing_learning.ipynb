It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a subfield of linguistics. Typically data is collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches in machine learning and deep learning. Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s.[1] Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language. The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts. 1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.[2] However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe[3]) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed. 1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\". Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time.[4] 1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981). During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY). 1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology[5]), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory[6]) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky. An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.[7] Up until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[8] 1990s: Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government. However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data. 2000s: With the growth of the web, increasing amounts of raw (unannotated) language data have become available since the mid-1990s. Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical. In 2003, word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, was outperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors.[9] In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling,[10] and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[11][12] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[13] and parsing.[14][15] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care[16] or protect patient privacy.[17] Symbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular:[18][19] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming. Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts, whereas the rule-based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally. language models, produced by either statistical or neural networks methods, are more robust to both unfamiliar (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted) in comparison to the rule-based systems, which are also more costly to produce. the larger such a (probabilistic) language model is, the more accurate it becomes, in contrast to rule-based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems. Although rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023. Before that they were commonly used: when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods, e.g., for the machine translation of low-resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system, for preprocessing in NLP pipelines, e.g., tokenization, or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines, e.g., for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses. In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.[20][21] The earliest decision trees, producing systems of hard if–then rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches. Only the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach. A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[22] the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach, using semantic networks[23] and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words. Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore. Neural machine translation, based on then-newly-invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation. The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks. Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.

As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[46] Interest on increasingly abstract, \"cognitive\" aspects of natural language (1999–2001: shallow parsing, 2002–03: named entity recognition, 2006–09/2017–18: dependency syntax, 2004–05/2008–09 semantic role labelling, 2011–12 coreference, 2015–16: discourse parsing, 2019: semantic parsing). Increasing interest in multilinguality, and, potentially, multimodality (English since 1999; Spanish, Dutch since 2002; German since 2003; Bulgarian, Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish since 2006; Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish since 2007; Czech since 2009; Arabic since 2012; 2017: 40+ languages; 2018: 60+/100+ languages) Elimination of symbolic representations (rule-based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods, representation learning and end-to-end systems) Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above). Cognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[47] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[48] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[49] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies. As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[50] with two defining aspects: Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as \"the understanding of one idea, in terms of another\" which provides an idea of the intent of the author.[51] For example, consider the English word big. When used in a comparison (\"That is a big tree\"), the author's intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience. When used metaphorically (\"Tomorrow is a big day\"), the author's intent to imply importance. The intent behind other usages, like in \"She is a big person\", will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information. Assign relative measures of meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed, e.g., by means of a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US Patent 9269353 (https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/055314712/publication/US9269353B1?q=pn%3DUS9269353):[52] Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[53] functional grammar,[54] construction grammar,[55] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[56] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[57] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit)[58] and developments in artificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches[59] and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle[60] by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J.

S2CID 30688575 (https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30688575). ^ Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of \"corner cases\" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics), typically created using thought experiments, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in corpus linguistics. The creation and use of such corpora of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing. In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called \"poverty of the stimulus\" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing. As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing. ^ Bengio, Yoshua; Ducharme, Réjean; Vincent, Pascal; Janvin, Christian (March 1, 2003). \"A neural probabilistic language model\" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944966).

In general, computational linguistics draws upon linguistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, logic, philosophy, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, anthropology and neuroscience, among others. The field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English.[1] Since rule-based approaches were able to make arithmetic (systematic) calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was expected that lexicon, morphology, syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules, as well. After the failure of rule-based approaches, David Hays[2] coined the term in order to distinguish the field from AI and co-founded both the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL) in the 1970s and 1980s. What started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing.[3][4] In order to be able to meticulously study the English language, an annotated text corpus was much needed. The Penn Treebank[5] was one of the most used corpora. It consisted of IBM computer manuals, transcribed telephone conversations, and other texts, together containing over 4.5 million words of American English, annotated using both part-of-speech tagging and syntactic bracketing.[6] Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of log-normality was found in relation to sentence length.[7] The fact that during language acquisition, children are largely only exposed to positive evidence,[8] meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and no evidence for what is not correct,[9] was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s.[10] It has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span,[11] which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children.[11] Robots have been used to test linguistic theories.[12] Enabled to learn as children might, models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words. Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure. Using the Price equation and Pólya urn dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modern-day languages.[13] Chomsky's theories have influenced computational linguistics, particularly in understanding how infants learn complex grammatical structures, such as those described in Chomsky normal form.[14] Attempts have been made to determine how an infant learns a \"non-normal grammar\" as theorized by Chomsky normal form.[9] Research in this area combines structural approaches with computational models to analyze large linguistic corpora like the Penn Treebank, helping to uncover patterns in language acquisition.[15] Philosophy portal Artificial intelligence in fiction Collostructional analysis Computational lexicology Computational Linguistics (journal) Computational models of language acquisition Computational semantics Computational semiotics Computer-assisted reviewing Dialog systems Glottochronology Grammar induction Human speechome project Internet linguistics Lexicostatistics Natural language processing Natural language user interface Quantitative linguistics Semantic relatedness Semantometrics Systemic functional linguistics Translation memory Universal Networking Language ^ John Hutchins: Retrospect and prospect in computer-based translation.

winter AI boom Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary Glossary vte v t e Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Quick progress in the field of deep learning, beginning in 2010s, allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance.[2] ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.[3][4] The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. Statistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.[6][7] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[8][9] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.[10][11] Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[12] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells.[13] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.[12] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.[12] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[14] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[15] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[16] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[17] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[18] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[19] Modern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.[20] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[22] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[23]: 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[23]: 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[24] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[23]: 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart, and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[23]: 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.[24] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[25][26][27] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[28] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[29] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[30] In unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression.[31] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[32] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[34] Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.[35] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[36] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[36] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[37] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[38] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[39] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks.[40] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.[41] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[5][42] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the Probably Approximately Correct Learning (PAC) model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[43] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.[5] Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.[44][45][46] Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[47] The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[48] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[18] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[49] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature. [50] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,[7] and density estimation.[51] Unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pan-genome.[52] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[54][55] Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[56] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[57] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[58] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization. Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modeling, meta-learning.[59] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).[60] It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[61] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62] Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[63] Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[64] and various forms of clustering.[65][66][67] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.[68] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[69] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.[70] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[71] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[72] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[73] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[74] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.[75] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,[76][77] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML). Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[78] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[79] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[80] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[81] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[82][83][84] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[85] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, after being \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions.[86] By extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.[87] Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[88] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[89] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[90]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams. A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization. A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[92][93] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[94] The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach[clarification needed] would combine probabilities. However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[4][9] However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[95] There are many applications for machine learning, including: Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decision-making Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[96] General game playing Handwriting recognition Healthcare Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Knowledge graph embedding Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time-series forecasting Tomographic reconstruction[97] User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[98] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[99] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[100] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[101] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[102] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[103] In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[104] Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers.[105] Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone's performance and thermal behavior based on the user's interaction with the phone.[106][107][108] When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.[109] Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.[110] Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.[111][112][113] Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.[114][115] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[116][117][118] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[119] The \"black box theory\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.[120] The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual’s life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[120] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[121] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[122][123] Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.[124] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.[125] Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[126] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[127][128] In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants.\"[129] In 2015, Google Photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[129] and in 2018, this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[130] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[131] In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[132] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[133] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"[134] Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.[135] It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.[136] By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[137] Learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[138] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[139][140] Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[141] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and/or evasion via adversarial machine learning.[142] Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and well-visible \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed and/or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.[143][144][145] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[146] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).[147] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[148] For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names.[126] Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.[149][150] Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.[129] While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.[151] In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, \"female faculty merely make up 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.[152] Furthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.[152] AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information. These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning.[153] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[154][155] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.[156] This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.[157] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.[158] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[159] OpenAI estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[160][161] A physical neural network or Neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse. \"Physical\" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.[162][163] Embedded Machine Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers.[164][165][166] Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing, henceforth, reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data, and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties, personal data and business secrets. Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration,[167][168] using approximate computing,[169] optimization of machine learning models and many more.[170][171] Pruning, Quantization, Knowledge Distillation, Low-Rank Factorization, Network Architecture Search (NAS) & Parameter Sharing are few of the techniques used for optimization of machine learning models.

Internet Lists Social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the creation, sharing and aggregation of content (such as ideas, interests, and other forms of expression) amongst virtual communities and networks.[1][2] Common features include:[2] Online platforms that enable users to create and share content and participate in social networking.[2][3][4] User-generated content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through online interactions.[2][3] Service-specific profiles that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.[2][5] Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.[2][5] The term social in regard to media suggests platforms enable communal activity. Social media can enhance and extend human networks.[6] Users access social media through web-based apps or custom apps on mobile devices. These interactive platforms allow individuals, communities, and organizations to share, co-create, discuss, participate in, and modify user-generated or self-curated content.[7][5][1] Social media is used to document memories, learn, and form friendships.[8] They may be used to promote people, companies, products, and ideas.[8] Social media can be used to consume, publish, or share news. Popular social media platforms with over 100 million registered users include Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, ShareChat, Instagram, Pinterest, QZone, Weibo, VK, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, Threads and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, Letterboxd, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, and TikTok. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.[according to whom?] Social media outlets differ from old media (e.g. newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality,[9] reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.[10] Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (many sources to many receivers) while traditional media operate under a monologic (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monologic#English) transmission model (one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city.[11] Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers, including exposure to inappropriate content, exploitation by adults, sleep problems, attention problems, feelings of exclusion, and various mental health maladies.[12][13] Social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy. The PLATO system was launched in 1960 at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation. It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowdsourced online newspaper, and blog and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. ARPANET, which came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the network etiquette (or \"netiquette\") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[14] ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1990s.[15] Usenet, conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, was the first open social media app, established in 1980. A precursor of the electronic bulletin board system (BBS), known as Community Memory, appeared by 1973. Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which launched on February 16, 1978. Before long, most major US cities had more than one BBS, running on TRS-80, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, IBM PC, Commodore 64, Sinclair, and others. CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s. Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.[16] Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee integrated HTML hypertext software with the Internet, creating the World Wide Web. This breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs, list servers, and email services. Message forums migrated to the web, and evolved into Internet forums, supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously. These early text-based systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century, aided by digital cameras and camera phones.[17] The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web 2.0.[6] Social media started in the mid-1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities, Classmates.com, and SixDegrees.com.[18] While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time, SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously. It boasted features like profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations, making it \"the very first social networking site\".[18][19] The platform's name was inspired by the \"six degrees of separation\" concept, which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else.[20] In the early 2000s, social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace, followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.[21] Research from 2015 reported that globally, users spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[22] likely fueled by the availability of smartphones.[23] As of 2023 as many as 4.76 billion people used social media[24] some 59% of the global population. A 2015 review identified four features unique to social media services:[2] Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.[2][3] User-generated content[2][3] User-created self profiles[2][5] Social networks formed by connections between profiles,[2][5] such as followers, groups, and lists. In 2019, Merriam-Webster defined social media as \"forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).\"[25] Social media encompasses an expanding suite of services:[26] Blogs (ex. HuffPost, Boing Boing) Business networks (ex. LinkedIn, XING) Collaborative projects (Mozilla, GitHub) Enterprise social networks (Yammer, Socialcast, Slack) Forums (Gaia Online, IGN) Microblogs (Twitter, Tumblr, Weibo) Photo sharing (Pinterest, Flickr, Photobucket) Products/services review (Amazon, Upwork) Social bookmarking (Delicious, Pinterest) Social gaming including MMORPG (Fortnite, World of Warcraft) Social network (Facebook, Instagram, Baidu Tieba, VK, QZone, ShareChat, WeChat, LINE) Video sharing (YouTube, Vimeo) Virtual worlds (Second Life, Twinity) Some services offer more than one type of service.[5] Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is distinguished by its ubiquity, since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer. Mobile services can further make use of the user's immediate location to offer information, connections, or services relevant to that location. According to Andreas Kaplan, mobile social media activities fall among four types:[27] Space-timers (location and time-sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time (posting about a traffic jam) Space-locators (only location sensitive): Posts/messages with relevance for a specific location, read later by others (e.g. a restaurant review) Quick-timers (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy (e.g. posting status updates) Slow-timers (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g. watching a video) Certain content has the potential to spread virally, an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual. One user spreads a post across their network, which leads those users to follow suit. A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours. Virality is not guaranteed; few posts make the transition. Viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns. Nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally. Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users re-share content, such as X's and Facebook's \"like\" option.[28] Bots are automated programs that operate on the internet.[29] They automate many communication tasks. This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers.[30] Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking, commenting, and following.[31] Bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing.[32] Bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis, as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions.[33] Some bots violate platforms' terms of use, which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically.[34] Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions.[35] 'Cyborgs'—either bot-assisted humans or human-assisted bots[35]—are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes, from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz.[36][37][38] A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time.[39] A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time. In other cases, cyborgs spread fake news.[35] Cyborgs may work as sock puppets, where one human pretends to be someone else, or operates multiple accounts, each pretending to be a person. A multitude of United States patents are related to social media, growing rapidly.[citation needed] As of 2020[update] (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_media&action=edit), over 5000 social media patent applications had been published in the United States.[40] Only slightly over 100 patents had been issued.[41] As an instance of technological convergence, various social media platforms adapted functionality beyond their original scope, increasingly overlapping with each other. Examples are the social hub site Facebook launching an integrated video platform in May 2007,[42] and Instagram, whose original scope was low-resolution photo sharing, introducing the ability to share quarter-minute 640×640 pixel videos[43] (late extended to a minute with increased resolution). Instagram later implemented stories (short videos self-destructing after 24 hours), a concept popularized by Snapchat, as well as IGTV, for seekable videos.[44] Stories were then adopted by YouTube.[45] X, whose original scope was text-based microblogging, later adopted photo sharing,[46] then video sharing,[47][48] then a media studio for business users, after YouTube's Creator Studio.[49] The discussion platform Reddit added an integrated image hoster replacing the external image sharing platform Imgur,[50] and then an internal video hosting service,[51] followed by image galleries (multiple images in a single post), known from Imgur.[52] Imgur implemented video sharing.[53][54] YouTube rolled out a Community feature, for sharing text-only posts and polls.[55] According to Statista, it is estimated that, in 2022, around 3.96 billion people were using social media globally. This number is up from 3.6 billion in 2020.[56] The following is a list of the most popular social networking services based on the number of active users as of January 2024[update] (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_media&action=edit) per Statista.[57] 1 Facebook 3,049 United States 2 YouTube 2,491 United States 3 WhatsApp 2,000 United States 3 Instagram 2,000 United States 5 TikTok 1,526 China 6 WeChat 1,336 China 7 Facebook Messenger 979 United States 8 Telegram 800 Russia 9 Douyin 752 China 10 Snapchat 750 United States 11 Kuaishou 685 China 12 Twitter 619 United States A 2009 study suggested that individual differences may help explain who uses social media: extraversion and openness have a positive relationship with social media, while emotional stability has a negative sloping relationship with social media.[59] A 2015 study reported that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation.[60] Common Sense Media reported that children under age 13 in the United States use social networking services although many social media sites require users to be 13 or older.[61] In 2017, the firm conducted a survey of parents of children from birth to age 8 and reported that 4% of children at this age used social media sites such as Instagram, Snapchat, or (now-defunct) Musical.ly \"often\" or \"sometimes\".[62] Their 2019 survey surveyed Americans ages 8–16 and reported that about 31% of children ages 8–12 use social media.[63] In that survey, teens aged 16–18 were asked when they started using social media. the median age was 14, although 28% said they started to use it before reaching 13. Social media played a role in communication during the COVID-19 pandemic.[64] In June 2020, a survey by Cartoon Network and the Cyberbullying Research Center surveyed Americans tweens (ages 9–12) and reported that the most popular application was YouTube (67%).[65] (as age increased, tweens were more likely to have used social media apps and games.) Similarly, Common Sense Media's 2020 survey of Americans ages 13–18 reported that YouTube was the most popular (used by 86% of 13- to 18-year-olds).[66] As children aged, they increasingly utilized social media services and often used YouTube to consume content.

During these days, people are forced to stay at home and the social media have connected and supported awareness and pandemic updates.\"[67] Healthcare workers and systems became more aware of social media as a place people were getting health information: \"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems.\"[68] This also led to the spread of disinformation. On December 11, 2020, the CDC put out a \"Call to Action: Managing the Infodemic\".[69] Some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on their Twitter data:[70] \"Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care.\"[70] However others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction, as it became an increasingly important context and therefore \"source of social validation and reinforcement\" and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful.[71] Governments may use social media to (for example):[72] inform their opinions to public interact with citizens foster citizen participation further open government analyze/monitor public opinion and activities educate the public about risks and public health.[73] Social media has been used extensively in civil and criminal investigations.[74] It has also been used to search for missing persons.[75] Police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public, publicize police activity, and burnish law enforcement's image;[76][77] conversely, video footage of citizen-documented police brutality and other misconduct has sometimes been posted to social media.[77] In the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identifies and track individuals via social media, and has apprehended some people via social media-based sting operations.[78] U.S. Customs and Border Protection (also known as CPB) and the United States Department of Homeland Security use social media data as influencing factors during the visa process, and monitor individuals after they have entered the country.[79] CPB officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border, searching both citizens and non-citizens without first obtaining a warrant.[79] As social media gained momentum among the younger generations, governments began using it to improve their image, especially among the youth. In January 2021, Egyptian authorities were reported to be using Instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program. The program was designed to revamp Egypt's image and to counter the bad press Egypt had received because of the country's human rights record. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in similar programs.[80] Similarly, Dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism. However, Dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities, or to criticize the city, politics or religion. The content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays Dubai in a negative light.[81] Many businesses use social media for marketing, branding,[82] advertising, communication, sales promotions, informal employee-learning/organizational development, competitive analysis, recruiting, relationship management/loyalty programs,[27] and e-Commerce. Companies use social-media monitoring tools to monitor, track, and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing, sales and other programs. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, tools. Social media offers information on industry trends. Within the finance industry, companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment. These range from marketing financial products, market trends, and as a tool to identify insider trading.[83] To exploit these opportunities, businesses need guidelines for use on each platform.[3] Business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence. Instead, it makes its case by participating in the \"conversation\".[84] Business uses social media[85] on a customer-organizational level; and an intra-organizational level. Social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, by highlighting successes, and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily available/known.[86] Social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections with customers. Social media marketing can be divided into paid media, earned media, and owned media.[87] Using paid social media firms run advertising on a social media platform. Earned social media appears when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it. Owned social media is the platform markets itself by creating/promoting content to its users.[88] Primary uses are to create brand awareness, engage customers by conversation (e.g., customers provide feedback on the firm) and providing access to customer service.[89] Social media's peer-to-peer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers, since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company.[90] Social media personalities, often referred to as \"influencers\", are Internet celebrities who are sponsored by marketers to promote products and companies online. Research reports that these endorsements attract the attention of users who have not settled on which products/services to buy,[91] especially younger consumers.[92] The practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as influencer marketing. In 2013, the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag #spon or #ad when endorsing. The US Federal Trade Commission issued similar guidelines.[93] Social media platforms also enable targeting specific audiences with advertising. Users of social media can share, and comment on the advertisement, turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers.[94] Targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users.[3] Companies can use humor (such as shitposting) to poke fun at competitors.[95] Advertising can even inspire fanart which can engage new audiences.[96] Hashtags (such as #ejuice and #eliquid) are one way to target interested users.[97] User content can trigger peer effects, increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement. A 2012 study focused on this communication reported that communication among peers can affect purchase intentions: direct impact through encouraging conformity, and an indirect impact by increasing product engagement. This study claimed that peer communication about a product increased product engagement.[98] Social media have a range of uses in politics.[99] Politicians use social media to spread their messages and influence voters.[100] Dounoucos et al. reported that Twitter use by candidates was unprecedented during the US 2016 election.[101][102] The public increased its reliance on social-media sites for political information.[101] In the European Union, social media amplified political messages.[103] Foreign-originated social-media campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country.[104][105] Social media was influential in the Arab Spring in 2011.[106][107][108][109] However, debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this.[110] Activists have used social media to report the abuse of human rights in Bahrain. They publicized the brutality of government authorities, who they claimed were detaining, torturing and threatening individuals. Conversely, Bahrain's government used social media to track and target activists. The government stripped citizenship from over 1,000 activists as punishment.[111] Militant groups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool.[112] Islamic State (also known as ISIS) used social media. In 2014, #AllEyesonISIS went viral on Arabic X.[113][114] Social media use in hiring refers to the examination by employers of job applicants' (public) social media profiles as part of the hiring assessment. For example, the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees and as a tool for talent acquisition.[115] This practice raises ethical questions. Employers and recruiters note that they have access only to information that applicants choose to make public. Many Western-European countries restrict employer's use of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin protect applicants and employees from surrendering usernames and passwords for social media accounts.[citation needed] Use of social media as caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media. A 2013 survey of 17,000 young people in six countries found that one in ten people aged 16 to 34 claimed to have been rejected for a job because of social media activity.[116][117] Scientists use social media to share their scientific knowledge and research on platforms such as ResearchGate, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, and Academia.edu.[118] The most common platforms are X and blogs. The use of social media reportedly has improved the interaction between scientists, reporters, and the general public.[citation needed] Over 495,000 opinions were shared on X related to science between September 1, 2010, and August 31, 2011.[119] Science related blogs respond to and motivate public interest in learning, following, and discussing science. Posts can be written quickly and allow the reader to interact in real time with authors.[120] One study in the context of climate change reported that climate scientists and scientific institutions played a minimal role in online debate, exceeded by nongovernmental organizations.[121] Academicians use social media activity to assess academic publications,[122] to measure public sentiment,[123] identify influencer accounts,[124] or crowdsource ideas or solutions.[125] Social media such as Facebook, X are also combined to predict elections via sentiment analysis.[126] Additional social media (e.g. YouTube, Google Trends) can be combined to reach a wider segment of the voting population, minimise media-specific bias, and inexpensively estimate electoral predictions which are on average half of a percentage point off the real vote share.[127] In some places, students have been forced to surrender their social media passwords to school administrators.[128] Few laws protect student's social media privacy. Organizations such as the ACLU call for more privacy protection. They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to resist.[129] Colleges and universities may access applicants' internet services including social media profiles as part of their admissions process. According to Kaplan, Inc, a corporation that provides higher education preparation, in 2012 27% of admissions officers used Google to learn more about an applicant, with 26% checking Facebook.[130] Students whose social media pages include questionable material may be disqualified from admission processes. \"One survey in July 2017, by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers, reported that 11 percent of respondents said they had refused to admit an applicant based on social media content. This includes 8 percent of public institutions, where the First Amendment applies. The survey reported that 30 percent of institutions acknowledged reviewing the personal social media accounts of applicants at least some of the time.\"[131] Social media comments and images have been used in court cases including employment law, child custody/child support, and disability claims. After an Apple employee criticized his employer on Facebook, he was fired. When the former employee sued Apple for unfair dismissal, the court, after examining the employee's Facebook posts, reported in favor of Apple, stating that the posts breached Apple's policies.[132] After a couple broke up, the man posted song lyrics \"that talked about fantasies of killing the rapper's ex-wife\" and made threats. A court reported him guilty.[132][clarification needed] In a disability claims case, a woman who fell at work claimed that she was permanently injured; the employer used her social media posts to counter her claims.[132] Courts do not always admit social media evidence, in part, because screenshots can be faked or tampered with.[133] Judges may consider emojis into account to assess statements made on social media; in one Michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment, the judge disagreed, noting that an emoji after the comment that indicated that it was a joke.[133] In a 2014 case in Ontario against a police officer regarding alleged assault of a protester during the G20 summit, the court rejected the Crown's application to use a digital photo of the protest that was anonymously posted online, because it included no metadata verifying its provenance.[133] Social media as a news source is the use of online social media platforms rather than moreover traditional media platforms to obtain news. Just as television turned a nation of people who listened to media content into watchers of media content in the 1950s to the 1980s, the emergence of social media has created a nation of media content creators. Almost half of Americans use social media as a news source, according to the Pew Research Center.[134] As a participatory platform that allows for user-generated content[135][136] and sharing content within one's own virtual network,[137][135] using social media as a news source allows users to engage with news in a variety of ways,[138] including: Consume news Discover news Share or repost news Post their own photos, videos, or reports of news (i.e., engage in citizen or participatory journalism) Comment on news Using social media as a news source has become an increasingly more popular way for old and young adults alike to obtain information. There are ways that social media positively affects the world of news and journalism but it is important to acknowledge that there are also ways in which social media has a negative effect on the news that people consume such as false news, biased news, and disturbing content. Social media are used to socialize with friends and family[141] pursue romance and flirt,[141] but not all social needs can be fulfilled by social media.[142] For example, a 2003 article reported that lonely individuals are more likely to use the Internet for emotional support than others.[143] A 2018 survey from Common Sense Media reported that 40% of American teens ages 13–17 thought that social media was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important for them to connect with their friends.[144] The same survey reported that 33% of teens said social media was extremely or very important to conduct meaningful conversations with close friends, and 23% of teens said social media was extremely or very important to document and share their lives.[144] A 2020 Gallup poll reported that 53% of adult social media users in the United States thought that social media was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with people during the COVID-19 pandemic.[145] In Alone Together Sherry Turkle considered how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication.[146] She claimed that people act differently online and are less concerned about hurting others' feelings. Some online encounters can cause stress and anxiety, due to the difficulty purging online posts, fear of getting hacked, or of universities and employers exploring social media pages. Turkle speculated that many people prefer texting to face-to-face communication, which can contribute to loneliness.[146] Surveys from 2019 reported evidence among teens in the United States[144] and Mexico.[147] Some researchers reported that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocal messages correlated with less loneliness.[148] In social media \"stalking\" or \"creeping\" refers to looking at someone's \"timeline, status updates, tweets, and online bios\" to find information about them and their activities.[149] A sub-category of creeping is creeping ex-partners after a breakup.[150] Catfishing (creating a false identity) allows bad actors to exploit the lonely.[151] Self-presentation theory proposes that people consciously manage their self-image or identity related information in social contexts.[152] One aspect of social media is the time invested in customizing a personal profile.[153] Some users segment their audiences based on the image they want to present, pseudonymity and use of multiple accounts on the same platform offer that opportunity.[154] A 2016 study reported that teenage girls manipulate their self-presentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers.[155] Teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance (likes, comments, and shares). When this does not go well, self-confidence and self-satisfaction can decline.[155] A 2018 survey of American teens ages 13–17 by Common Sense Media reported that 45% said likes are at least somewhat important, and 26% at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos.[144] Some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain,[156] and some may resort to online bullying.[157] according to a 2016 study, users' reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers.[158] A 2016 review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos, self-comparison, disappointment, and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved.[159] One 2016 study reported that Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior.[160] People portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way.[155] However, upon seeing one person's curated persona, other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. One 2017 study reported that problematic social media use (i.e., feeling addicted to social media) was related to lower life satisfaction and self-esteem.[161] Studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health.[162][163] In one study, women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction; while men reported them as the second biggest factor.[164] While monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media, the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with one's own may increase their impact. A 2021 study reported that 87% of women and 65% of men compared themselves to others on social media.[165] Efforts to combat such negative effects focused promoting body positivity. In a related study, women aged 18–30 were reported posts that contained side-by-side images of women in the same clothes and setting, but one image was enhanced for Instagram, while the other was an unedited, \"realistic\" version. Women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction.[166] Social media can offer a support system for adolescent health, because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant.[167] For example, in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing obesity treatment, participants' claimed that social media allowed them to access personalized weight-loss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity.[168][169] While social media can provide health information, it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information.[169] The National Eating Disorders Association reported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content.[169][170] Health literacy offers skills to allow users to spot/avoid such content. Efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success.[171] Social media such as pro-anorexia sites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging health-related behaviors through social media, especially among adolescents.[172][173][174] During the coronavirus pandemic, inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media.[175] Topics subject to distortion included treatments, avoiding infection, vaccination, and public policy. Simultaneously, governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy.[176] Heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories, leading to worse mental health[177] and less compliance with public health recommendations.[178] Social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addiction-related behaviors, with studies report that excessive use can lead to addiction-like symptoms. These symptoms include compulsive checking, mood modification, and withdrawal when not using social media, which can result in decreased face-to-face social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness.[179] A 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media. It concluded that blue light from computer/phone displays—and the frequency rather than the duration of time spent, predicted disturbed sleep, termed \"obsessive 'checking'\".[183] The association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults.[184] A recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance. The median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61. Females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance.[185] Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones, and this left them tired and unfocused in school.[186] A 2011 study reported that time spent on Facebook was negatively associated with GPA, but the association with sleep disturbance was not established.[187] One studied effect of social media is 'Facebook depression', which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media.[8] This may lead to reclusiveness, which can increase loneliness and low self-esteem.[8] Social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling.[184] Studies report children's self-esteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments. This affected self-perception.[188] A 2017 study of almost 6,000 adolescent students reported that those who self-reported addiction-like symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low self-esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms.[189] A second emotional effect is social media burnout, defined as ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization. Ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media. Emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media. Depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media. The three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media.[190] A third emotional effect is \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO), which is the \"pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.\"[191] It is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media.[191] Social media can also offer support as Twitter has done for the medical community.[192] X facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students, while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes, comments, and posts.[193] Access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected, after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones.[194] Some commentators refer to social media as 'anti-social media' when describing its social impact.[195][196] The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet.[197][198] The digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources. In the Information Age, people without access to the Internet and other technology are at a disadvantage, for they are unable or less able to connect with others, find and apply for jobs, shop, and learn.[197][199] Many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content.[204][205] Because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users' political preferences, one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure. Political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes. Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them.[206] Aviv Ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content,[207] but could be designed to reduce polarization instead.[208] In 2017, Facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button, which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity, misinformation and low-quality news.[209] Some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts.[210][211][207] Some advocate for media literacy as a solution.[212] Others argue that less social media,[206] or more local journalism[213][214][215] could help address political polarization. A 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes.[216] Stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease.[217] Elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media.[218] Social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication, despite different ways of communicating in various cultures.[219] Social media has affected the way youth communicate, by introducing new forms of language.[220] Novel acronyms save time, as illustrated by \"LOL\", which is the ubiquitous shortcut for \"laugh out loud\". The hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others. Hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement, mark content for future use, and allow other users to contribute to a discussion.[221] For some young people, social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications, made worse by pandemic isolation, delaying the development of conversation and other social skills.[222] What is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media.[223] The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that bullying, the making of non-inclusive friend groups, and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying, privacy issues, and sending sexual images or messages. Sexting and revenge porn became rampant, particularly among minors, with legal implications and resulting trauma risk.[224][225][226][227] However, adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online.[228] Social media, can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch, making more friends, and engaging in community activities.[8] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_media&action=edit&section=). (July 2024) In July 2014, in response to WikiLeaks' release of a secret suppression order made by the Victorian Supreme Court, media lawyers were quoted in the Australian media to the effect that \"anyone who tweets a link to the WikiLeaks report, posts it on Facebook, or shares it in any way online could also face charges\".[229] On 27 July 2020, in Egypt, two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting TikTok videos, which the government claimed as \"violating family values\".[230] In the 2014 Thai coup d'état, the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison.[citation needed] Historically, platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented. They set rules for what was allowable, decided which content to promote and which to ignore. The US enacted the Communications Decency Act in 1996. Section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" (47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)). In 2024, legislation was enacted in Florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts, and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14, and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval.[231][232] The European Union initially took a similar approach.[233] However, in 2020, the European Commission presented two legislative proposals: The Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Both proposals were enacted in July 2022. The DSA entered into force on 17 February 2024, the DMA in March 2024.[234] This legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives, articulated by MEPs: \"What is illegal offline must also be illegal online\".[235] \"Very large online platforms\" must therefore, among other things delete illegal content (propaganda, election interference, hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse) and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a \"high level of privacy, security and protection of minors\", by prohibiting advertising based on personal data, designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment, and not use sensitive personal data such as race, gender and religion to target advertising.[236] delete illegal content (propaganda, election interference, hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse) and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a \"high level of privacy, security and protection of minors\", by prohibiting advertising based on personal data, designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment, and not use sensitive personal data such as race, gender and religion to target advertising.[236] Violators could face a complete ban in Europe or fines of up to 6% of global sales. Such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers.[237] Enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance.[238] The DSA allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction. According to Patrick Breyer from the German Pirate Party, a problem could arise from the Hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of Victor Orban, as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied EU-wide.[239] 2018 Nobel Laureate Paul Romer[240] advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms.[237] Similar to a carbon tax – negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms.[241] Assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities, the revenue raised could be used to address them. However, consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms, nor to craft a tax, . Another proposal is to invoke competition law.[242] The idea is to restrict the platforms' market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law. This would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines. In a 2024 opinion piece, Megan Moreno and Jenny Radesky, professors of pediatrics, wrote about the need for \"nuanced\" policy.[243] They regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful. They commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions \"may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages\".[244] In June 2024, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people.[245] The business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers. Platforms provide access to data about each user, which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them. This strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible, increasing the number of ads that they see. Platforms such as X add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues.[246] The enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism, debate, and controversy. Criticisms include platform capabilities, content moderation and reliability,[247] impact on concentration, mental health,[248] content ownership, and the meaning of interactions, and poor cross-platform interoperability,[249] decrease in face-to-face interactions, cyberbullying, sexual predation, particularly of children, and child pornography.[250][251] In 2007 Andrew Keen wrote, \"Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated. Under these rules, the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering.\"[252] Social media has become a regular source of news and information. A 2021 Pew Research Center poll reported roughly 70% of users regularly get news from social media,[4] despite the presence of fake news and misinformation. Platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy, and many do not vet content at all, although in some cases, content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced.[253][254][255] Content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance, responding instead to the contents' virality. In 2018, researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70% faster than truthful news on X.[7] Social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users.[10] Some platforms attempt to discover and block bots, with limited success.[11] Fake news seems to receive more user engagement, possibly because it is relatively novel, engaging users' curiosity and increasing spread.[23] Fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event, before conventional media are prepared to publish.[20][16] Social media mining is the process of obtaining data from user-generated content on social media in order to extract actionable patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information. Mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research. The term is an analogy to the process of mining for minerals. Mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals; likewise, social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage, online behaviour, content sharing, connections between individuals, buying behaviour. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies, introduce programs, products, processes or services. Social media mining uses concepts from computer science, data mining, machine learning, and statistics. Mining is based on social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, optimization and mathematics. It attempts to formally represent, measure and model patterns from social media data.[256] In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations began mining to learn about customers, clients and others. Platforms such as Google, Facebook (partnered with Datalogix and BlueKai) conduct mining to target users with advertising.[257] Scientists and machine learning researchers extract insights and design product features.[258] Users may not understand how platforms use their data.[259] Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements without reading them, leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users' privacy. Malcolm Gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated. He concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves, that expression likely has no impact beyond social media. What he called \"high-risk activism\" involves strong relationships, coordination, commitment, high risks, and sacrifice.[261] Gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that \"social networks are effective at increasing participation—by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires.\"[261] According to him, \"Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice.\"[261] Disputing Gladwell's theory, a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity.[262] Social media content is generated by users. However, content ownership is defined by the Terms of Service to which users agree. Platforms control access to the content, and may make it available to third parties.[263] Although platform's terms differ, generally they all give permission to utilize users' copyrighted works at the platform's discretion.[264] After its acquisition by Facebook in 2012, Instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users.[265][266] It then reversed these changes, with then-CEO Kevin Systrom promising to update the terms of service.[267][268] Privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data. Information is captured without the user's knowing consent. Data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes.[269][263] Information may be offered for third party use. Young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators.[270] While social media users claim to want to keep their data private, their behavior does not reflect that concern, as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles. In addition, platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles. This data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising.[271] A 2014 Pew Research Center survey reported that 91% of Americans \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used. Some 80% of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms, and 64% said the government should do more to regulate advertisers.[272] In 2019, UK legislators criticized Facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data.[273] In 2019 the Pentagon issued guidance to the military, Coast Guard and other government agencies that identified \"the potential risk associated with using the TikTok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information.\"[274] As a result, the military, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and Department of Homeland Security banned the installation and use of TikTok on government devices.[275] In 2020 The US government attempted to ban TikTok and WeChat from the States over national security concerns. However, a federal court blocked the move.[276] In 2024, the US Congress passed a low directing TikTok's parent company ByteDance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the US. The company sued, challenging the constitutionality of the ban.[277] Internet addiction \"disorder\" (IAD), also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use, is a problematic compulsive use of the internet, particularly on social media, that impairs an individual's function over a prolonged period of time. Young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder,[278] with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online.[279] Some experience health consequences from loss of sleep[280] as they stay up to continue scrolling, chatting, and gaming.[281] Excessive Internet use is not recognized as a disorder by the World Health Organization, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).[282] However, gaming disorder appears in the ICD-11.[283] Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity, or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. Definitions are not standardized or agreed upon, complicating the development of evidence-based recommendations. Users under 30 access the Internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse.[284] In 2011 the term \"Facebook addiction disorder\" (FAD) emerged.[285] FAD is characterized by compulsive use of Facebook. A 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use and narcissism, reporting \"FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms)\".[286][287] In 2020, the documentary The Social Dilemma, reported concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social media's pursuit of addictive use. For example, when a user has not visited Facebook for some time, the platform varies its notifications, attempting to lure them back. It also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality.[288] Whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous.[291] A study of Americans aged 12–15, reported that teenagers who used social media over three hours/day doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety.[292] Platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content. A 2023 study of Australian youth reported that 57% had seen disturbingly violent content, while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images.[293] Further, youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullying.[citation needed] As result, phones have been banned from some schools, and some schools in the US have blocked social media websites.[294] Social media often features in political struggles. In some countries, Internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in Turkey after the Taksim Gezi Park protests. Both X and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A law granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (TİB) personnel. The TİB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order.[295] Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of X was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.[296] Internet censorship in the United States is the suppression of information published or viewed on the Internet in the United States. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship. Free speech protections allow little government-mandated Internet content restrictions. However, the Internet is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.[297] Gambling, cyber security, and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the US[297] Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred, often after lengthy legal battles.[298] However, the government has exerted pressure indirectly. With the exception of child pornography, content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to remove/suppress content, following state encouragement or the threat of legal action.[299][297] While the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable, open source protocols such as ActivityPub have been adopted by platforms such as Mastodon, GNU social, Diaspora, and Friendica. They operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteer-operated servers, called the Fediverse. However, in 2019, Mastodon blocked Gab from connecting to it, claiming that it spread violent, right-wing extremism.[305] In December 2019, X CEO Jack Dorsey advocated an \"open and decentralized standard for social media\". He joined Bluesky to bring it to reality.[306] Deplatforming, also called no-platforming, is a form of Internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their information/ideas. This typically involves suspension, outright bans, or reducing spread (shadow banning).[307][308] A number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational, emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on.[311] Zack Beauchamp of Vox calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats.[312] The Economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats.[313] Informed dialogue, a shared sense of reality, mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media.[314] Political polarization can be one byproduct.[315][316][317] This has implications for the likelihood of political violence.[318][206] Siva Vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing anti-trust laws.[195] Andrew Leonard describes Pol.is as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies, citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus.[319][320] According to LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media,[321] the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities, corporations, and governments, but also extremist groups.[322] The use of social media by ISIS and Al-Qaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers. Social media platforms and encrypted-messaging applications have been used to recruit members, both locally and internationally.[323] Platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content. Extreme nationalist groups, and more prominently, US right-wing extremists have used similar online tactics. As many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech, several platforms became popular among right-wing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events; these application became known as \"Alt-tech\". Platforms such as Telegram, Parler, and Gab were used during the January 6 United States Capitol attack, to coordinate attacks.[324] Members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives; some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians.[325] Social media content, persists unless the user deletes it. After a user dies, unless the platform is notified, their content remains.[326] Each platform has created guidelines for this situation.[327] In most cases on social media, the platforms require a next-of-kin to prove that the user is deceased, and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a 'legacy' status. X[328] The company works with an immediate family member to deactivate the account. Additionally, X will not give the account to any other person, regardless of the relationship. Facebook Users have the option of having their account permanently deleted after death. Users can identify a 'legacy contact' who would take over the account after. Instagram[329] Users can have the account memorialized or deleted with proof of death. LinkedIn[330] A family member can request that the account be deleted. The family member must identify the account, submit proof of relationship, the user's email address, date of death, a link to the obituary, and the name of the last company the deceased worked for. Pinterest Must email the company with the URL of the account along with a death certificate or a link to the obituary, as well as proof of relationship to the deceased. YouTube[331] A representative can close the account, transfer payments from the account to an immediate family member and legal representative of the user's estate, and can provide the data in the account to a family member.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) publishes a recommendation entitled Notation for national and international telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and Web addresses. Recommendation E.123 specifies the format of telephone numbers assigned to telephones and similar communication endpoints in national telephone numbering plans. In examples, a numeric digit is used only if the digit is the same in every number, and letters to illustrate groups. X is used as a wildcard character to represent any digit in lists of numbers. All telephone numbers in Djibouti have eight digits. Fixed line numbers start with 21 or 27, then a fixed line locality code, followed by four digits. Mobile numbers start with 77, then a mobile line locality code, followed by four digits. With the country code of Djibouti (253), the international format is \"+253 XX YY ZZZZ\". All telephone numbers in Morocco have ten digits (initial 0 plus nine numbers). Landline numbers start with 05, followed by two digits for the regional area RR, then two digits for the local area LL, then 4 digits for the subscriber number XX XX: (\"05 RR LL XX XX\" or \"05RR LL XX XX\"). Mobile numbers start with 06 or 07, followed by the subscriber number (\"06 XX XX XX XX\" or \"07 XX XX XX XX\"). The country code for Morocco is 212, so the format becomes \"+212 Y XX XX XX XX\" or \"+212 YXX XX XX XX\", also \"+212 YXX-XXXXXX\" as well, where Y is 5 for landlines or 6/7 for mobile. Free calling numbers (green numbers) or call center numbers start with 080 or 090. Telephone numbers in Kenya use a 9-digit format. The nine digits used for local calls start with a \"0\" (trunk prefix) for domestic calls, followed by the 3-digit area/provider code and the final six digits (07XX XXX XXX). The international code for Kenya is \"+254\". South Africa uses 10-digit dialling, which has been required since 16 January 2007. The ten digits used for local calls (AAA XXX XXXX or 0AA XXX XXXX) consist of a 3-digit area/type code (the first digit in the area/type code is a trunk prefix) followed by seven digits. All area codes, including mobile numbers, start with a \"0\" (trunk prefix) for domestic calls. When dialing from another country, the country code for South Africa is \"27\", with the rest of the digits excluding the \"0\" trunk prefix (+27 AA XXX XXXX). Telephone numbers in China have 10 or 11 digits (excluding an initial zero which is required at times) and fall in at least four distinct categories: Landlines: In China, the length of phone numbers varies from city to city. It is usually written as (0XXX) YYY YYYY (For landlines registered in large metropolises, it is written in the format (0XXX) YYYY YYYY), where 0 is the trunk code, XXX is the area code (2 or 3 digits) and YYYY YYYY is the local number (7 or 8 digits). For example, (0755) XXXX YYYY indicates a Shenzhen number. XXXXYYYY is dialed locally, 0755 XXXX YYYY is dialed in other areas inside the country, while, for international calls to Shenzhen, the 0 is dropped and is written +86 755 XXXX YYYY. Mobiles: The 11-digit code is always written in full in the whole China e.g. 1WX YYYY ZZZZ. Each WX is assigned to a service provider while W is usually '3' through '9'. The remaining eight digits are the subscriber number. Toll Free: These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 800 or 400. 800 (toll-free) are accessible only when called from landline phones, while 400 (shared toll) are accessible from all phones. 400 XXX XXXX or 800 XXXX XXXX. Service numbers: These are usually 3- to 5-digit numbers (e.g. Police is 110) used to access an emergency service (Fire 119, Ambulance 120, Police 110, Roadside assistance 12122) or a value-added service. Every number, except special service numbers, is an 8-digit number; they are grouped as XXXX YYYY. There are no area codes. Telephone numbers in India have ten digits (excluding an initial zero which is required at times) and fall into at least four distinct categories: Landlines: Written as AAA-BBBBBBB, where AAA is the Subscriber Trunk Dialing code (long-distance code) and BBBBBBB is the phone number. The total length of the Subscriber Trunk Dialing code and the phone number is ten digits. The Subscriber Trunk Dialing code can have from two digits (11 or 011) up to four digits. Mobiles: Written as AAAAA-BBBBB for ease of remembering (though the prefix is either 2-digits or 4-digits in the numbering plan). Mobile numbers which are not local need to be prefixed by a 0 while dialing, or by +91 (91 is the country code for India). A mobile number written as +91-AAAAA BBBBB is valid throughout India, and in other countries where the + is recognized as a prefix to the country code. Since 2015, calls from mobile phones to any other mobiles do not need to prefix with a 0. However, calls from landlines to non-local mobile numbers need to be prefixed with 0. Toll Free: These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 1-800. Sometimes they are accessible (or are toll-free) only when called from the government-owned telephone corporation, BSNL/MTNL. Service numbers: These are usually three or four digit numbers (e.g. Police is 100) used to access an emergency service (Fire, Ambulance, Police, Roadside assistance) or a value-added service. All telephone numbers in Iran have 11 digits (initial 0 and ten digits). The first two or three digits after the zero are the area code. The possibilities are: (0xx) xxxx xxxx (for landlines), 09xx xxx xxxx (for cellphones) and 099xx xxx xxx (for MVNO). When making a call within the same landline area code, initial 0 plus the area code must be omitted. An example for calling telephones in the city of Tehran is as follows: xxxx xxxx (within Tehran, via a landline) 021 xxxx xxxx (Outside Tehran, or via a cellphone) +98 21 xxxx xxxx (outside Iran) An example for mobile numbers is as follows: 09xx xxx xxxx (in Iran) +98 9xx xxx xxxx (outside Iran) The traditional convention for phone numbers is (0AA) NXX-XXXX, where 0AA is the area code and NXX-XXXX is the subscriber number. This number format is very similar to the North American numbering plan, but the country has a trunk code of 0 instead of 1, so international callers (using +81) do not have to dial the trunk code 0 when calling to Japan. Telephone numbers had nine digits in Tokyo and Osaka until the late 1990s, when a seventh digit was added to the subscriber number. Densely populated areas have shorter area codes, while rural areas have longer area codes, but the last two digits of a five-digit area code (including the first zero) may also be the first two digits of the subscriber number. Area codes increase from north to south, except in areas such as the western Hokuriku region and the prefecture of Okinawa, where area codes increase from west to east or south to north. Some telephone numbers deviate from this rule: Toll-free dialing and Navi Dial operations (0120-XX-XXXX, 0570-XX-XXXX, or 0800-XX-XXXX), where XX-XXXX is the subscriber number The area code 050 uses an 11 digit phone number (050-XXXX-XXXX), where XXXX-XXXX is the subscriber number 110 and 119 are examples of three digit emergency numbers All area codes including mobile start with a \"0\" (trunk prefix) for domestic calls. If you are dialing from another country the international calling code for Malaysia is \"60\" which may be confusing; do not dial an extra \"0\" before the rest of the digits. For fixed line and mobile phone numbers, a dash is written in between the area/mobile code and the subscriber number, with an optional space before the last four digits of the subscriber number. For example, a fixed line number in Kuala Lumpur is written as 03-XXXX YYYY or 03-XXXXYYYY, while a fixed line number in Kota Kinabalu is written as 088-XX YYYY or 088-XXYYYY. A typical mobile phone number is written as 01M-XXX YYYY or 01M-XXXYYYY. Toll-free and local charge numbers are written as 1-800-XX-YYYY and 1-300-XX-YYYY respectively, while premium rate numbers are written as 600-XX-YYYY. Telephone numbers in Pakistan have two parts. Area codes in Pakistan have from two to five digits; the smaller the city, the longer the prefix. All the large cities have two-digit codes. Smaller towns have a six digit number. Large cities have seven-digit numbers. Azad Jammu and Kashmir has five digit numbers. On 1 July 2009, telephone numbers in Karachi and Lahore were changed from seven digits to eight digits. This was accomplished by adding the digit \"9\" to the beginning of any phone number that started with a \"9\" (government and semi-government connections), and adding the digit \"3\" to any phone numbers that did not start with the number \"9\".[1] It is common to write phone numbers as (0xx) yyyyyyy, where xx is the area code. The 0 prefix is for trunk (long-distance) dialing from within the country. International callers should dial +92 xx yyyyyyyy. All mobile phone codes have four digits, and start with 03xx. All mobile numbers have seven digits, and denote the mobile provider on a nationwide basis and not geographic location. Thus all Telenor numbers (for example) nationwide carry mobile code 0345 etc. Universal access number 111 xxx xxx Emergency Service Numbers 1xx 1xxx Premium Rate services: 0900 xxxxx Toll free numbers (For callers within Pakistan): 0800 xxxxx Landline numbers are eleven digits long[2] and written as +63 (XX) YYY ZZZZ for international callers. For domestic calls, the country code (+63) is omitted and a trunk prefix (0) is placed. For local calls, both the trunk prefix (0) and the area code are omitted. Mobile numbers are twelve digits long[3] and written as +63 (XXX) YYY ZZZZ or 0 (XXX) YYY ZZZZ. In Singapore, every phone number is written as +65-XXXX-YYYY or +65 XXXX YYYY. Mobile phones starts with 8/9, landline phone numbers starts with 6 while VOIP numbers starts with 3. Subscriber numbers have eight digits and there are no area codes. Except for short codes and emergency numbers, all telephone numbers in Sri Lanka have ten digits (initial 0 + nine numbers). Landline phone numbers begin with the area code, then one digit for the operator code, then six digits for the primary telephone number. Format: (XXX Y ZZZZZZ) where: \"xxx\" denotes the area code. All area codes begin with the number 0. The operator code for fixed (landline) numbers is \"y\". \"zzzzzz\" denotes the primary telephone number, which has six digits. Mobile numbers start with the mobile operator code (which begins from 07X, followed by seven digits for the main telephone number). Format: (XXX ZZZZZZZ) where: When dialing a mobile number, \"xxx\" represents the mobile operator code. All mobile operator codes begin with the number 07. \"zzzzzzz\" represents the main telephone number of seven digits. The country code for Sri Lanka is 94, so the format becomes \"+94 XX Y ZZZZZZ\" for landlines and the format becomes \"+94 XX ZZZZZZZ\" for mobile numbers.[4] South Korean phone numbers can be as short as seven digits and as long as 11 digits, because, when making a local call (i.e. in the same city), there is no need to dial the area code. South Korean area codes are assigned based on city. Landline home numbers are usually written as: 0XX-XXX-XXXX or (0XX) XXX-XXXX where 0XX indicates an area code. (0XX) XXX-XXX and 0XX XXX XXXX (without hyphens) are comprehensible as well. The area code may have two digits for some cities such as Seoul and Gwacheon (these two cities use the same area code) and three digits for other cities such as Incheon, Busan and most of the cities in Gyeonggi-do. The middle three-digit part is extended to four digits in many areas due to the increased number of telephone users. In the international context, 82 0XX-XXX-XXXX is commonly used as well. For international calls, \"0\" in the area code is often omitted, because it is not necessary to dial 0 from foreign countries. Therefore, it is better written as: 82-(0)XX-XXX-XXXX or 82-(0)XX-XXXX-XXXX The plus (+) sign is often added to the country code (e.g., +82 0XX-XXX-XXXX or +82-0XX-XXXX-XXXX). For mobile numbers, 016490641 so on. As with the landline home numbers, the mobile numbers' middle three-digit part is extended to four digits (e.g., 016490641) due to the increased number of mobile phone users. If a number starts with 070, the number does not belong to any particular area, and is a number given by an Internet telephone service. In this case, 070 is not usually put in the brackets, neither ( ) nor ). In the business context, the numbers in the format of 15XX-XXXX and 16XX-XXXX are business representative agency or customer services. While the numbers starting with 080 (e.g., 080-XXX-XXXX) are also business-related numbers but are usually toll-free customer service centers. Also in this case, 15XX, 16XX or 070 are not put in the brackets, neither ( ) nor ). There are national telephone services which have phone numbers in the format of 1XX or 1XXX, without any area code. For example, 114 is for telephone yellow page, 119 is for fire/emergency number, 112 is for police station center, 131 is for weather forecast information, 1333 is for traffic information, and so on. The number 111 is for reporting spies, especially from North Korea. It used to be 113, so most of senior citizen still believe it is the number for reporting spies. These numbers do not need any brackets. If there are multiple numbers used for one person/entity, the symbol \"~\" is usually used to avoid repetitions. For example, if one company has three phone numbers—031-111-1111, 031-111-1112 and 031-111-1113—then they are shortened as in 031-111-1111~3. If the numbers are not consecutive, then the last digit is written together with commas. For example, if a company has three numbers—031-111-1111, 031-111-1115, 031-111-1119, then they are shortened as in 031-111-1111, 5, 9. Landline numbers in Taiwan are written with the area code in parentheses [with phone numbers total nine digits] Example: (02) XXXX YYYY for phone numbers in Taipei area. Mobile phones have 3 digit \"company code\" assigned to different mobile service carriers such as (09**) XXXXXX followed by a 6 digit phone number. (note: Mobile carriers could have multiple company codes) All numbers in Thailand, whether for landlines or mobile reception, consist of eight digits, xxxx xxxx in the government's official format. When calling domestically, landline numbers are preceded by a zero (0 xxxx xxxx, example 0 5381 0595) while mobile numbers are preceded by 0 plus one digit (0x xxxx xxxx, example 06 9756 4509). Thais often confuse the current numbering system with the old provincial area code system, which no longer exists as area codes were integrated into all phone numbers in 2005. Because of this, unofficially people often write numbers as 0xx xxx xxx (053 810 595). Calling a Thai phone number from outside Thailand, one drops the 0 and adds the 66 country code. Example +66 5381 0595.[5] Most Australian telephone numbers have ten digits, and are generally written 0A BBBB BBBB or 04XX XXX XXX for mobile telephone numbers, where 0A is the optional \"area code\" (2,3,7,8) and BBBB BBBB is the subscriber number. (http://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Numbering/Numbering-Plan/phone-number-meanings-numbering-i-acma (http://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Numbering/Numbering-Plan/phone-number-meanings-numbering-i-acma)) When the number is to be seen by an international audience, it is written +61 A BBBB BBBB or +61 4XX XXX XXX. When written for a local audience, the optional area code is omitted. The area code is often written within parentheses (0A) BBBB BBBB. Mobile numbers should never have parentheses. Ten-digit non-geographic numbers beginning with 1 are written 1X0Y BBB BBB, where X = 8 for toll free numbers, X = 3 for fixed-fee numbers and X = 9 for premium services. Six-digit non-geographic numbers are written 13 BB BB or 13B BBB; these are fixed-fee numbers. Seven-digit 180 BBBB numbers also exist. 'B's are sometimes written as letters. Almost all New Zealand telephone numbers have seven digits, with a single-digit access code and a single-digit area code for long-distance domestic calls. Traditionally, the number was given as (0A) BBB-BBBB, with the two first digits (the STD code) often omitted for local calls. The brackets and the dash are also often omitted. Mobile numbers follow the same format, but with the area code being two digits, i.e. (02M) BBB-BBBB. ( Some mobile numbers are longer: (021)02BBBBBB, (021)08BBBBBB, (020)40BBBBBB, (020) 41BBBBBB and (028) 25BBBBBB; and some are shorter: (021)3BBBBB, (021)4BBBBB, (021)5BBBBB, (021)6BBBBB, (021)7BBBBB, (021)8BBBBB and (021)9BBBBB) There are also free-phone numbers (starting with 0800 or 0508) that are given in the format 0800-AAA-AAA. It is not uncommon for the 0800 and 0508 to be enclosed in brackets, although this is not strictly correct as the brackets denote optional parts of the number, and the 0800 and 0508 is required.[6] Recently with 8 digit mobile numbers becoming more common the prefix-4 digits-4 digits format has been adopted for readability: 022 1234 5678. For international use, the prefix 64 is substituted for the leading zero, giving +64-A-BBB-BBBB for land-lines, and +64-MM-BBB-BBBB for mobile numbers. Belgian telephone numbers consist of three parts: First '0', secondly the \"zone prefix\" (A) which has one or two digits for landlines and three digits for mobile phones, and thirdly the \"subscriber's number\" (B). Land lines always have nine digits. They are prefixed by a zero, followed by the zone prefix. Depending on the length of the zone prefix, the subscriber's number consists of either 6 or 7 digits. Hence land line numbers are written either 0AA BB BB BB or 0A BBB BB BB. Mobile phone numbers always consist of ten digits. The first digit of the \"zone prefix\" of a mobile number is always '4'. Then follows 2 digits indicating to which Mobile Operator's pool the number originally belonged when it was taken into usage. The fourth digit represents a \"sub-group\" of this pool and has no additional meaning other than increasing the amount of possible numbers. The subscriber's number consists of six digits. Hence, mobile phone numbers are written 04AA BB BB BB. Sometimes, the last six digits are written in two groups of 3 digits to increase readability: 04AA BBB BBB. Numbers are sometimes written with a slash in between the zone prefix and the subscriber's number. This is the case for both land lines and mobile phone numbers. Sometimes, dots are written between the blocks of the subscriber's number. Examples: 0AA/BB BB BB, 0AA/BB.BB.BB; for mobile numbers: 04AA/BB BB BB, 04AA/BB.BB.BB or 04AA/BBB.BBB. The international code prefix for Belgium is \"32\". When dialing a number with the prefix, the 0 can be dropped, e.g.: +32 9055. Danish telephone numbers have eight digits and are normally written in four groups of two digits each, with the groups separated by spaces: AA AA AA AA, in two groups of four digits each, with the groups separated by a space: AAAA AAAA, in one group of two digits followed by two groups of three digits each, with the groups separated by spaces: AA AAA AAA, or all in one go: AAAAAAAA. The third option, AA AAA AAA is not commonly used for personal (landline or mobile) numbers, but is mostly found in corporate numbers, especially in advertizing. The standard formats – which when spoken divide numbers into ranges from 00 (zero zero) to 99 (ninety-nine) – limit the possible range of the ability to create telephone numbers that are easy to remember; dividing the numbers into groups of three expands the mnemonic possibilities. Danish emergency and service numbers have three digits and are written AAA. Danish short numbers used for text messaging services have four digits and are written AAAA. French telephone numbers have ten digits, usually written in groups of two separated by spaces, in the format 0A BB BB BB BB where 0 (the trunk prefix) was created in 1996 to be a carrier selection code, and A is the \"territorial area code\" included in the subscriber number A BB BB BB BB. Sometimes, it is also written in the format 0A.BB.BB.BB.BB using periods instead of spaces, but this is less common. The A (territorial area code) can be 1 to 5 (for geographic-based numbers, according to location: Paris/Suburbs, northwest France, northeast France, southeast France, and southwest France, respectively), and it designates nationwide numbers when it is 6 or 7 (mobile numbers), 8 (special numbers), or 9 (phone over IP over xDSL/non-geographic numbers). The numbering plan is a closed one; all digits must always be dialed. The first two or three B can designate the area (old area code) for geographic numbers, or the operator to whom the number resource belongs. There are also \"short numbers\" for emergencies (such as 112), that are written 1C or 1CC; and short numbers for special services, written 10 CC, 11C CCC, or 36 CC. 00 is the international access code. International format is +33 A BB BB BB BB where the leading trunk prefix 0 disappears (it must not be dialed from abroad). This format can be directly used in mobile phones. German telephone numbers have no fixed length for area code and subscriber number (an open numbering plan). There are many ways to format a telephone number in Germany. The most prominent is DIN 5008 but the international format E.123 and Microsoft's canonical address format are also very common. Trunk access code is 0 and international call prefix code is 00. DIN 5008 0AAAA BBBBBB DIN 5008 with Extension 0AAAA BBBBBB-XX DIN 5008 international +49 AAAA BBBBBB E.123 local (0AAAA) BBBBBB E.123 international +49 AAAA BBBBBB Microsoft +49 (AAAA) BBBBBB Old 0AAAA-BBBBBB Very old 0AAAA/BBBBBB-XX Numbers are often written in blocks of two. Example: +49 (A AA) B BB BB (Note the blocks go from right to left) The (very) old format and E.123 local form are still in use, sometimes for technical reasons. Greek telephone numbers have ten digits, and usually written AAB BBBBBBB or AAAB BBBBBB where AAB or AAAB is the 2- or 3-digit national area code plus the first digit of the subscriber number, and BBBBBBB or BBBBBB are the remaining digits of the subscriber number. The entire number must always be dialed, even if calling within the same local area; therefore, the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number. According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +30 AAB BBBBBBB or +30 AAAB BBBBBB to include the country calling code. In Hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two, except for Budapest (the capital), which has the area code 1. Subscribers' numbers have six digits in general. Numbers in Budapest and cell phone numbers have seven digits. Phone numbers in Iceland have seven digits and generally written in the form XXX XXXX or XXX-XXXX. Phone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan with varying number lengths. The area code system is similar to that in some other northern European countries. Unlike the UK, Irish fixed line numbering is divided into a number of regions which are (except Dublin) further subdivided in a hierarchical structure, with the largest town often (but not always) taking 0A1. Area codes start with a trunk prefix \"0\" and extend for up to four digits but usually 3; followed by the local phone number of up to seven digits. In industry jargon, these area codes and prefixes are referred to as NDCs (National Dialing Codes). This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD code (Subscriber Trunk Dialling) was used. However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion. Dublin uses the shorter (01) code which is not further subdivided. Other cities and major towns usually have codes ending in 1. Cork for example is 021, Galway 091, Limerick 061 etc. The leading zero is always omitted when dialling from outside the country. Local phone numbers have either 5, 6 or 7-digits. In 7-digit numbering they are usually grouped as BBB BBBB, 6-digit numbers are grouped BBB BBB and 5-digit numbers are normally all grouped together BBBBB Grouping of numbers is not strictly adhered to, but usually fairly consistent. The area code should always be kept separated with a space or surrounded by brackets and not merged into the local number. The use of hyphens is discouraged, particularly on websites as it can prevent mobile browsers identifying the number as a clickable link for easier dialling. Fixed line numbers are normally presented as follows: 01 BBB BBBB for a Dublin number (7 digit) 021 BBB BBBB for a Cork number (7 digit) 064 BBB BBBB for a Killarney number (7 digit) 061 BBB BBB for a Limerick number (6 digit) 098 BBBBB for a Westport number (5 digit) 0404 BBBBB for a Wicklow number (5 digit) Area codes may also be surrounded by brackets, but this practice is falling out of use, as local dialing without the area code is optional on landlines and the area code must always be dialled on mobile phones. The Irish telecommunication regulator, ComReg has been gradually rationalising area codes by merging and extending local numbering to 7-digits in the format 0AA BBB BBBB. This is being carried out only where necessary to avoid disruption. This means that varying fixed line number lengths will continue to exist in Ireland for the foreseeable future. Mobile numbers are presented as follows: 08A BBB BBBB Brackets should not be used around the mobile prefix as it is never optional and must always be dialled, even from another phone with the same prefix. Special rate numbers, such as free phone/toll free and premium rate are usually grouped: Freephone: 1800 BB BB BB or (spoken as one-eight-hundred) Local rate: 1850 BB BB BB (eighteen-fifty) 1550 BB BB BB (read as fifteen-fifty) However, for memorability, this is not consistently adhered to. Alphanumeric characters can also be used in presenting numbers for added memorability, but it is much less common than in North America. For example: 18AA 99 TAXI Note: These special rate numbers are not reachable from outside Ireland.[7] Phone numbers in Italy have variable length. There's no well established convention about how to group digits or which symbol to use, but this is hardly an issue since all the digits are always dialed. Since 10 October 1995 (Operation Decibel) all telephone numbers in the Netherlands have ten digits (including the trunk prefix '0'). The area code ('A') is commonly separated with a dash ('-') and sometimes a space from the subscriber's number ('B'). Alternatively, the area code (including the trunk prefix) can be enclosed in parentheses. The length of the area code for landlines is either 2 or 3 digits, depending on the population density of the area. This leaves 7 or 6 digits for the subscriber's number, resulting in a format of either 0AA-BBBBBBB or 0AAA-BBBBBB. Cellphone numbers are assigned the 1-digit area code 6, leaving eight digits for the subscriber's number: 06-CBBBBBBB, where subscriber's number ('C') is neither 6 nor 7. Service numbers (area codes 800, 900, 906 and 909) have either 4 or 7 remaining digits, making them 8 or 11 digits in total: 0AAA-BBBB or 0AAA-BBBBBBB. The area code 14 has no trunk prefix and is used for government numbers, currently only for municipalities. The remaining digits represent the area code of the municipality. Therefore, the length 14 numbers total either 5 or 6 digits: 14 0AA or 14 0AAA The trunk prefix '0' is dropped when prefixed by the country code: +31 AA BBBBBBBB, +31 6 CBBBBBBB, etcetera. Note that there is not a trunk prefix for the 14 series so the international number becomes +31 14 0AAA. Norwegian telephone numbers have eight digits. A number to a fixed line is written in four groups of two separated by spaces, AA AA AA AA. Phone numbers in the 8xx series are written in three groups, AAA AA AAA. This makes it easy to determine if the B-number is SMS capable. Mobile numbers start with 4 or 9. Telephone numbers in Poland have nine digits. For mobile phones, the preferred format is AAA-AAA-AAA. For landline phones, the preferred format is AA-BBB-BB-BB, where AA is area code. Occasionally, you can encounter numbers formatted as (AA) BBB-BB-BB. Omitting area code is not permitted, because nowadays it is always required. Telephone numbers in Portugal have nine digits. A number to a fixed line is written in three groups of two separated by spaces, AAA AAA AAA. Cellphone numbers are written in three groups, AAA AAA AAA. Mobile numbers start with 9. Starting with 2002 phone numbers in Romania have ten digits, the first digit always being 0. The preferred format is AAAA-AAA-AAA for mobile, except for landline phones in Bucharest where the preferred format is AAA-AAA-AA-AA. Russia has an open numbering plan with 10-digit phone numbers. Trunk prefix is 8 (or 8~CC when using alternative operators, where CC is 21–23, 52–55). International call prefix is 8~10 (or 8~CC when using alternative operators, where CC is 26–29, 56–59). The country code is 7. Length of geographical area codes (A) is usually 3 to 5 digits; length of non-geographical area codes is 3. The groups of digits in the local subscriber's number (B) are separated by dashes ('-'): BBB-BB-BB, BB-BB-BB, B-BB-BB. The area code is included in parentheses, similarly to E.123 local notation: (AAA) BBB-BB-BB, (AAAA) BB-BB-BB, (AAAAA) B-BB-BB. Area code dialing is optional in most geographical area codes, except Moscow (area codes 495, 498, 499); it is mandatory for non-geographical area codes. E.123 international and Microsoft formats are used for writing local phone numbers as well; international prefix and country code 7 are replaced with trunk code 8 (or 8~CC) when dialing a mandatory area code. Even though trunk code is not needed for calls within the same geographical area, recent convention adds the default trunk code to the phone number notation: 8 (AAAA) BB-BB-BB. For mandatory area code dealing plans, notation 8 AAAA BB-BB-BB is used. These formats are a mix of Microsoft format and E.123 local notation. Mobile phones require full 10-digit number which starts with 3-digit non-geographical area codes 900–990. For international calls abroad or international roaming calls to Russia, E.123 international notation with an international call prefix '+' is the only allowed calling number format. For local calls both 8 and 7 are accepted as a trunk code. Old BBB-BB-BB Old with area code (AAA) BBB-BB-BB Conventional 8 (AAA) BBB-BB-BB Microsoft +7 (AAA) BBB-BB-BB Conventional (mandatory area code) 8 AAA BBB-BB-BB E.123 international +7 AAA BBB BB BB Spanish telephone numbers have nine digits, starting with '9' or '8' for fixed lines (excluding '90x' and '80x') or with '6' or '7' for mobile phones. The first group in fixed lines always identifies the dialed province. That group might be of 2 or 3 digits; for example, 91 and 81 are for Madrid while 925 and 825 are for Toledo. The second group is always of 3 digits as it formerly identified the telephone exchange (it now identifies the telephone area). When the first group has two digits (as in Madrid), the number is usually written in four groups of 2-3-2-2 digits (AB CCC DD DD) When the first group has three digits (as in Toledo), the number is usually written in 3 groups of 3 digits (ABB CCC DDD) but the form 3-2-2-2 (ABB CC CD DD) is not uncommon. Mobile numbers are usually grouped by threes, ABB CCC CCC, but the form 3-2-2-2 is also seen. Swedish telephone numbers have between eight and ten digits. They start with a two to four digit area code. A three digit code starting with 07 indicates that the number is for a mobile phone. All national numbers start with one leading 0, and international destinations are specified by the prefix 00 or +. The numbers are written with the area code followed by a hyphen, and then two to three groups of digits separated by spaces.[8] National 10 digit 0A-XXX XXX XX 0AA-XXX XX XX 0AAA-XX XX XX 0A-XXX XXX XX 0AA-XXX XX XX 0AAA-XX XX XX National 9 digit 0A-XXX XX XX 0AA-XX XX XX 0AAA-XXX XX 0A-XXX XX XX 0AA-XX XX XX 0AAA-XXX XX National 8 digit 0A-XX XX XX 0AA-XXX XX 0A-XX XX XX 0AA-XXX XX Mobile 10 digit 07A-XXX XX XX 07AA-XX XX XX 07A-XXX XX XX 07AA-XX XX XX International +CC AAA-XXX XX XX 00CC AAA-XXX XX XX +CC AAA-XXX XX XX 00CC AAA-XXX XX XX Swiss telephone numbers have ten digits, and usually written 0AA BBB BB BB where 0AA is the national destination code and BBB BB BB is the subscriber number. The entire number must always be dialed, including the leading 0, even if calling within a local area, therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number. According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +41 AA BBB BB BB to include the country calling code. Certain nationwide destination codes, such as for toll-free or premium-rate telephone numbers, are written 0800 BBB BBB or 0900 BBB BBB. Short numbers are used for emergency services such as 112 that are written 1CC or 1CCC. In Turkey the format for telephone numbers is commonly seen as 0BBB AAA AA AA. While landline numbers having the prefix 02BB AAA AA AA, 03BB AAA AA AA, or 04BB AAA AA AA[9] mobile numbers have the prefix 05BB AAA AA AA. Landline area codes are separated by cities and only one city, Istanbul, has two area codes: 216 for the Asian side, and 212 for the European side. Mobile numbers however are separated by carriers. There are three mobile carriers in Turkey: Vodafone TR, Turkcell and Turk Telekom. Turkcell has the prefix 053B AAA AA AA, Vodafone TR has the prefix 054B AAA AA AA, and Turk Telekom has the prefix 055B AAA AA AA. Since 9 November 2008, with the passing of the Number Carriability Regulation by ICTA, mobile numbers can be carried from one mobile carrier to the other, without having to change the prefix.[10] This caused dialing 05BB to call another number on the same carrier to become mandatory. Calls to numbers which were carried to another operator are signaled by a unique sound upon dialing, to signify that the recipient is on another network and alert them against potentially unwanted interconnection charges. The same regulation passed on 10 September 2009 regarding landline numbers, without the requirement to dial the prefix among numbers with the same geographical area, sharing the same prefix. The \"0\" on every prefix is an Area Code Exit code that must be dialed when a number with a different area code is being called. So when calling from outside of Turkey those 0s are not dialed. The dialing format when calling from outside Turkey is +90 BBB AAA AA AA and NOT +90 0BBB AAA AA AA. Unlike the North American system, the Country Exit Code isn't 011 but 00. So it is one \"0\" to exit area and one more \"0\" to exit the country. There are many recommendations for recording phone numbers. The most common in the world is Recommendation E.123 E.123 International Telecommunication Union[11] and the standard format for Microsoft telephone numbers Microsoft.[12] There is an international format for recording a telephone number containing the country code, settlement code and telephone number, and the national format containing the settlement code and telephone number. To record Ukrainian telephone numbers, telephone codes for settlements do not have an initial zero, long-distance prefix: 0. +380 44 123 45 67 E.123, international format: country code, settlement code and telephone number are separated by spaces (044) 123 45 67 E.123, national format: long-distance prefix and city code in parentheses (national format: long-distance prefix and settlement code in parentheses due to possible confusion needs constant additional clarification), п. 2.8 [11] ), the phone number is separated from the code and separated by spaces +380 (44) 1234567 Microsoft, international format: country code, space code, settlement code in brackets, space code, telephone number. Dialling codes, also known as \"area codes\" are optional for local callers (often surrounded by parentheses, or separated with a dash), though there are trials running to make them mandatory,[13] and are followed by the customer's telephone number. Codes with the form 02x are followed by 8-digit local numbers and are usually written as 02x AAAA AAAA or (02x) AAAA AAAA. Area codes with the form 011x or 01x1 are used for many of the major population centres in the UK, are always followed by 7-digit local numbers and are usually written as 01xx AAA BBBB, (01xx) AAA BBBB or 01x1-AAA BBBB (the latter formerly the recommended format for six major metropolitan areas in the UK). Other area codes have the form 01xxx with 5 or 6 figure local numbers written as 01xxx or (01xxx) followed by subscriber number AAAAA or AAAAAA; or have the form 01xx xx with 4 or 5 figure local numbers written as 01xx xx or (01xx xx) followed by subscriber number AAAA or AAAAA. Numbers for mobile phones and pagers are formatted as 07AAA BBBBBB and most other non-geographic numbers are 10 figures in length (excluding trunk digit '0') and formatted as 0AAA BBB BBBB. However, these numbers are sometimes written in other formats. 9 figure freephone numbers are 0500 AAAAAA and 0800 AAAAAA and there is one number of 8 figures length: 0800 1111 (Childline). Domestically, there are also a number of special service numbers such as 100 for the operator, 123 for the speaking clock and 155 for the international operator, as well as 118 AAA for various directory enquiry services, and 116 AAA for various helplines. For some services, the number you call will depend on which operator you use to connect the call. 112 and 999 work for calling the emergency services. These numbers cannot be called from abroad. When calling from abroad, the initial '0' trunk prefix is not required; it is, however, commonplace to represent telephone numbers with both the international code and the '0' trunk prefix - which is typically placed within parentheses - but this representation is inconsistent with the E.123 international standard.[14] Twenty-four countries and territories share the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), with a single country code, 1. The formatting convention for telephone numbers is (NPA) NXX-XXXX, where NPA is the three-digit area code, and NXX-XXXX is the seven-digit subscriber number.[15] NPA has the same syntax of NXX since the implementation of interchangeable area codes in 1995. The prefix NXX of the subscriber number is the central office code, unique in the numbering plan area. The place holder N stands for the digits 2 to 9, as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1. It is a closed telephone numbering plan in which all subscriber telephone numbers have seven digits, in addition to the three-digit area code. Under all-number calling, a numbering plan introduced around 1960, local calls within an area code were placed by dialing NXX-XXXX, omitting the area code, known as seven-digit dialing. Only calling a destination in a different area code required dialing the destination area code, known as ten-digit dialing. Due to the need for a larger telephone number pool in many regions, seven-digit dialing is becoming rare in the United States. With the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century, many metropolitan areas saw the introduction of additional area codes. Multiple area codes were assigned to the same numbering plan area, a configuration known as an overlay numbering plan. Calls within an overlay are still local calls, despite the need for ten-digit dialing. In general, placing long-distance calls requires dialing the trunk code 1, but this may be optional in some areas. Canada is a member of the North American Numbering Plan, but administers its numbering resources individually, under guidance from the NANP Administrator. The Canadian government has stated on its Language Portal of Canada that telephone numbers are to be written with a hyphen between each sequence, as follows: 1-NPA-NXX-XXXX or NPA-NXX-XXXX.[16] 10-digit dialing is now required throughout most of Canada, including all of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, as well as most of Ontario. Areas not yet requiring 10-digit dialing are Ontario's 807 area code, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, although 10-digit dialing may be accepted in some of these areas. In the province of Québec, where French is the first language, the Office québécois de la langue française has established that telephone numbers must be written with spaces first and then a hyphen for the last sequence, as follows: 1 NPA NXX-XXXX.[17] Mexican telephone numbers have ten digits. They can consist of a two-digit (NN) area code and an eight-digit local number (ABCD XXXX) or a three-digit area code (NNN) with a seven-digit local number (ABC XXXX). As of August 3, 2019 all the indicators and access codes (01, 044, 045) are deprecated, therefore all telephone numbers, for landline or mobile service, are dialed with ten digits.[18] The formatting convention of a telephone number is ABCD XXXX or NN ABCD XXXX or (NN) ABCD-XXXX ABC XX XX or NNN ABC XXXX or (NNN) ABC-XX-XX The international country code prefix for Mexico is 52. When dialing a number it must be formatted as \"plus sign + country code + 10-digit number\" e.g.: +52 NNN ABC XXXX Some Central American countries write the country code for their own and other Central American countries in parentheses, instead of using a + sign, as recommended by E.123. For example, for a number in Costa Rica they would write (506) 2222-2222 instead of +506 2222-2222. On the other hand, Guatemala does have the custom of using the + sign. It is quite common for Central American businesses to write the whole phone number, including the country code in parentheses, on business cards, signs, stationery, etc. Costa Rican telephone numbers have eight digits, and are usually written in the format 2NNN-NNNN (for landlines), 8NNN-NNNN (for mobile telephone numbers from local telephone company ICE), 6NNN-NNNN (for mobile telephone numbers from Movistar) and 7NNN-NNNN (for mobile phone numbers from Claro).[19] Toll-free numbers use the format 800-NNN-NNNN and premium-rate telephone numbers are written 90x-NNN-NNNN where x varies according to the type of service offered. There are also \"short numbers\" for emergencies such as 911. When Costa Rica switched from 7- to 8-digit numbers, it used a scheme similar to the 8-digit number scheme already in place in El Salvador at that time. El Salvadoran telephone numbers have eight digits, usually written in the format 2NNN-NNNN (for landline use) and 7NNN-NNNN (for mobile telephone numbers). Premium-rate numbers start with a 9. Guatemalan telephone numbers have eight digits and written in the format 2NNN-NNNN for landlines in Guatemala City, 6NNN-NNNN for landlines for the rest of municipalities in the Guatemala Department, and 7NNN-NNNN for landlines in Rural Guatemala / rest of country. Non-geographic numbers (mobile) are 5NNN-NNNN, 4NNN-NNNN, and 3NNN-NNNN. Within each area, there are different service providers. The following 3 digits indicate the service provider. However, their assignment is on a first-come first-served basis. Additionally there are special numbers with the following conventions: 3 digit numbers for emergency systems, four digit numbers, 15NN for information and governmental institutions and 17NN for commercial and banking institutions with a high call influx, 6 digit numbers for Telephone carriers numbers and making operator assisted calls, collect calls. These calls are billed at different rates. 1-800: Toll-free calls redirected to out of country offices and 1-801: Local toll-free calls.[20] Honduran telephone numbers have either seven digits (for landlines), which are usually written NNN-NNNN, or eight digits (for mobile numbers), which are written NNNN-NNNN. The fact that landline and mobile numbers are different lengths sometimes causes confusion. In 2010, an additional digit (2) was added to the start of land line numbers, thus standardizing the length at eight digits. Argentine telephone numbers always consist of 11 digits, including the geographical area code. The area code can have 3, 4 or 5 digits, the first being always 0 (indicative of long-distance calls). Moreover, in 1999 the whole country (except Buenos Aires, and Greater Buenos Aires) was divided into two zones. Roughly and with exceptions, one includes most of the northern half of the country; and the other, most of the southern half, though the actual reason for this division is not geographical, but the fact that each zone is administered by a different company. So, the second digit of area codes can be 1 (only in Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires code \"011\") or else a 2 (for towns in the southern half of the country) or a 3 (for the northern half). For example, (011) for Buenos Aires, (0341) for Rosario, (02627) for San Rafael. And the subscriber's number will accordingly have 6, 7 or 8 digits, to complete the eleven digits. Phone numbers are mostly written as: (011) xxxx-xxxx (Note that only the (011) code has 3 digits), (0xxx) xxx-xxxx or (0xxxx) xx-xxxx The area code is usually written between brackets. In 1999, a general reform was introduced to telephone numbers, including the 1, 2 and 3 for area codes as explained above, and adding a 4 at the beginning of all subscriber's numbers. However, since the reform some local numbers starting with a 5 are beginning to appear. Moreover, a hyphen is usually placed to separate the last four digits. Code areas do not usually include one single city or town, but several neighbouring towns. So, the part before the hyphen (called a prefix) is usually indicative of either a town within the code area, or even of a part of a larger city, which is assigned several prefixes. As a matter of fact, each area code has only a limited number of prefixes assigned, and these are locally limited within the area. For example, the (0342) area has numbers with a 456- prefix, mostly located in the centre of Santa Fe. It also has numbers with a 460- prefix, usually for phone lines in the north east of the city. And there are lines with a 474- prefix, located in Santo Tomé. But no 444- prefix exists within this area. As for the part after the hyphen, it may usually be any succession of four digits, though sometimes a prefix is shared by two or more small towns, and then, the first digit after the hyphen carries the distinction between towns. Sometimes, a prefix is reserved for official numbers, that is for offices depending on the national, provincial or local state. In the (0342) area, this is 457-, and phones within this prefix communicate with each other, by simply dialing the four final digits, though from other phones the prefix must be dialled as well. Mobile phones use the same area codes as landline telephones, but the number begins with a \"15\", added to a string of 6, 7 or 8 digits, just as described above. After the \"15\", the remainder of the number can start with a 3, a 4, a 5 or a 6. This \"15\" may be dropped when a call is made to a mobile phone in a different code area. And when sending text messages, the receiver's number is best dialled both without the \"15\" and with the long-distance code, even if both sender and receiver share a code area, but without the initial \"0\". To sum up, given the mobile phone (011) 154-123-4567, you will call it by dialing: 154-123-4567 (within the same code area), (011) [15]4-123-4567 (from a different code area, including or omitting the 15), And you will send messages to: 11 4-123-4567 (even when your phone has also a 011 number). Two sorts of special numbers exist in Argentina. On the one hand, three-digit numbers are used for special services such as to call the police, fire brigade or emergency doctors, as well as to hear the official time. Also telephone companies have three-digit numbers to report a problem in the lines, or to ask for another subscriber's number, when a paper directory is not available. Additionally, there are other longer numbers. These include (but are not limited to): 0800 xxx abcd 0810 xxx abcd 0600 xxx abcd (where the xxx indicates the same digit dialled three times, and a, b, c and d may each be any of the ten digits) 0800 lines are used by companies, and it is the receiver and not the caller who pays for the call, so that potential clients are encouraged to contact business companies for free. 0810 lines are paid by the caller, but the cost is for a local call, even if you are calling from a different area. The remaining is covered by the receiver. And 0600 numbers are special more expensive lines, that serve such purposes as TV games, fund collecting for charity companies, hot lines, etc. Basically a part of the extra money charged to the caller is sent to the owner of the line. Often the abcd or even (xx)xabcd part of the number is chosen, if available, to form a word that is representative of the company holding the number. Brazil is divided into 67 two-digit geographical area codes, all of which with eight-digit numbers, in the format AA NNNN-NNNN, except for cell phones, which contain nine digits, usually in the format AA 9NNNN-NNNN. Peru uses 2-digit area codes followed by 6-digit subscriber numbers outside of Lima. In Lima the area code is \"1\" and the subscriber number has seven digits, divided XXX XXXX. The \"trunk 0\" is often used, especially for numbers outside Lima. For example, a phone number in Arequipa might be written (054) XX-XXXX. Cellphone numbers used to have eight digits with the first digit always being 9. In 2008 an additional digit was added to cellphone numbers, while land numbers remained the same. The previous convention for cell numbers in Lima was usually 9XXX XXXX, though 9-XXX XXXX was also used. With the new 9-digit number, the form 9XX XXX XXX is becoming increasingly common as opposed to 9 XXXX XXXX, 9X XXX XXXX or 9XXXX XXXX. Outside Lima cellphone numbers used to be 9 followed by six digits, i.e., 9 XXX XXX. The 2008 changes were somewhat more complicated. In four departments (similar to states), a 2 digit code now has to be entered before the 9. In the example of Arequipa, the code of 95 has to be entered before the 9, so the new numeration is 959 XXX XXX. The other codes are 94 for La Libertad (Trujillo), 96 for Piura and 97 for Lambayeque (Chiclayo). In the other 19 rural departments, the 9 is followed by the department's 2-digit area code then the 6-digit subscriber number. For example, the area code for Cusco is 84, so their new cellphone numeration is 984 XXX XXX. The effect is that all Peruvian cellphone numbers now have nine digits; under the old system they had eight digits in Lima and 7 everywhere else.[21] Long distance calling Short code ^ \"Karachi and Lahore now have eight digit phone numbers.

It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a subfield of linguistics. Typically data is collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches in machine learning and deep learning. Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s.[1] Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language. The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts. 1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.[2] However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe[3]) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed. 1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\". Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time.[4] 1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981). During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY). 1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology[5]), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory[6]) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky. An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.[7] Up until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[8] 1990s: Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government. However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data. 2000s: With the growth of the web, increasing amounts of raw (unannotated) language data have become available since the mid-1990s. Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical. In 2003, word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, was outperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors.[9] In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling,[10] and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[11][12] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[13] and parsing.[14][15] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care[16] or protect patient privacy.[17] Symbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular:[18][19] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming. Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts, whereas the rule-based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally. language models, produced by either statistical or neural networks methods, are more robust to both unfamiliar (e.g. containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and erroneous input (e.g. with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted) in comparison to the rule-based systems, which are also more costly to produce. the larger such a (probabilistic) language model is, the more accurate it becomes, in contrast to rule-based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems. Although rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023. Before that they were commonly used: when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods, e.g., for the machine translation of low-resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system, for preprocessing in NLP pipelines, e.g., tokenization, or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines, e.g., for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses. In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.[20][21] The earliest decision trees, producing systems of hard if–then rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches. Only the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach. A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[22] the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach, using semantic networks[23] and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words. Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore. Neural machine translation, based on then-newly-invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation. The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks. Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.

As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[46] Interest on increasingly abstract, \"cognitive\" aspects of natural language (1999–2001: shallow parsing, 2002–03: named entity recognition, 2006–09/2017–18: dependency syntax, 2004–05/2008–09 semantic role labelling, 2011–12 coreference, 2015–16: discourse parsing, 2019: semantic parsing). Increasing interest in multilinguality, and, potentially, multimodality (English since 1999; Spanish, Dutch since 2002; German since 2003; Bulgarian, Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish since 2006; Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish since 2007; Czech since 2009; Arabic since 2012; 2017: 40+ languages; 2018: 60+/100+ languages) Elimination of symbolic representations (rule-based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods, representation learning and end-to-end systems) Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above). Cognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[47] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[48] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[49] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies. As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[50] with two defining aspects: Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as \"the understanding of one idea, in terms of another\" which provides an idea of the intent of the author.[51] For example, consider the English word big. When used in a comparison (\"That is a big tree\"), the author's intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience. When used metaphorically (\"Tomorrow is a big day\"), the author's intent to imply importance. The intent behind other usages, like in \"She is a big person\", will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information. Assign relative measures of meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed, e.g., by means of a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US Patent 9269353 (https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/055314712/publication/US9269353B1?q=pn%3DUS9269353):[52] Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[53] functional grammar,[54] construction grammar,[55] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[56] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[57] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit)[58] and developments in artificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches[59] and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle[60] by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J.

S2CID 30688575 (https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30688575). ^ Chomskyan linguistics encourages the investigation of \"corner cases\" that stress the limits of its theoretical models (comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics), typically created using thought experiments, rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in real-world data, as is the case in corpus linguistics. The creation and use of such corpora of real-world data is a fundamental part of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing. In addition, theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the so-called \"poverty of the stimulus\" argument entail that general learning algorithms, as are typically used in machine learning, cannot be successful in language processing. As a result, the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing. ^ Bengio, Yoshua; Ducharme, Réjean; Vincent, Pascal; Janvin, Christian (March 1, 2003). \"A neural probabilistic language model\" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944966).

In general, computational linguistics draws upon linguistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, logic, philosophy, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics, anthropology and neuroscience, among others. The field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages, particularly Russian scientific journals, into English.[1] Since rule-based approaches were able to make arithmetic (systematic) calculations much faster and more accurately than humans, it was expected that lexicon, morphology, syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules, as well. After the failure of rule-based approaches, David Hays[2] coined the term in order to distinguish the field from AI and co-founded both the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL) in the 1970s and 1980s. What started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing.[3][4] In order to be able to meticulously study the English language, an annotated text corpus was much needed. The Penn Treebank[5] was one of the most used corpora. It consisted of IBM computer manuals, transcribed telephone conversations, and other texts, together containing over 4.5 million words of American English, annotated using both part-of-speech tagging and syntactic bracketing.[6] Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of log-normality was found in relation to sentence length.[7] The fact that during language acquisition, children are largely only exposed to positive evidence,[8] meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided, and no evidence for what is not correct,[9] was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s.[10] It has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span,[11] which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children.[11] Robots have been used to test linguistic theories.[12] Enabled to learn as children might, models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions, perceptions, and effects were created and linked to spoken words. Crucially, these robots were able to acquire functioning word-to-meaning mappings without needing grammatical structure. Using the Price equation and Pólya urn dynamics, researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modern-day languages.[13] Chomsky's theories have influenced computational linguistics, particularly in understanding how infants learn complex grammatical structures, such as those described in Chomsky normal form.[14] Attempts have been made to determine how an infant learns a \"non-normal grammar\" as theorized by Chomsky normal form.[9] Research in this area combines structural approaches with computational models to analyze large linguistic corpora like the Penn Treebank, helping to uncover patterns in language acquisition.[15] Philosophy portal Artificial intelligence in fiction Collostructional analysis Computational lexicology Computational Linguistics (journal) Computational models of language acquisition Computational semantics Computational semiotics Computer-assisted reviewing Dialog systems Glottochronology Grammar induction Human speechome project Internet linguistics Lexicostatistics Natural language processing Natural language user interface Quantitative linguistics Semantic relatedness Semantometrics Systemic functional linguistics Translation memory Universal Networking Language ^ John Hutchins: Retrospect and prospect in computer-based translation.

winter AI boom Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary Glossary vte v t e Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Quick progress in the field of deep learning, beginning in 2010s, allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance.[2] ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.[3][4] The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. Statistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.[6][7] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning. The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[8][9] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.[10][11] Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[12] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells.[13] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.[12] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.[12] By the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[14] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[15] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[16] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[17] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"[18] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[19] Modern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.[20] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.[22] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[23]: 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[23]: 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[24] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[23]: 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart, and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[23]: 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.[24] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[25][26][27] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[28] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[29] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[30] In unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression.[31] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[32] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[34] Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.[35] According to Michael I. Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics.[36] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.[36] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[37] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,[38] wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.[39] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks.[40] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.[41] A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience.[5][42] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the Probably Approximately Correct Learning (PAC) model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error. For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.[43] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.[5] Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.[44][45][46] Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.[47] The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[48] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[18] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.[49] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature. [50] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,[7] and density estimation.[51] Unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pan-genome.[52] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[54][55] Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[56] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[57] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[58] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization. Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modeling, meta-learning.[59] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA).[60] It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[61] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62] Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[63] Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[64] and various forms of clustering.[65][66][67] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.[68] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[69] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.[70] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[71] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.[72] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[73] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[74] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.[75] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,[76][77] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML). Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".[78] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[79] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets.[80] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.[81] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.[82][83][84] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.[85] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, after being \"trained\" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions.[86] By extension, the term \"model\" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.[87] Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[88] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[89] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[90]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams. A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization. A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[92][93] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[94] The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach[clarification needed] would combine probabilities. However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[4][9] However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[95] There are many applications for machine learning, including: Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decision-making Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[96] General game playing Handwriting recognition Healthcare Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Knowledge graph embedding Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time-series forecasting Tomographic reconstruction[97] User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[98] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[99] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[100] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[101] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[102] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[103] In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[104] Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers.[105] Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone's performance and thermal behavior based on the user's interaction with the phone.[106][107][108] When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.[109] Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.[110] Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.[111][112][113] Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.[114][115] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[116][117][118] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[119] The \"black box theory\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.[120] The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual’s life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[120] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[121] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[122][123] Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.[124] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.[125] Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[126] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[127][128] In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants.\"[129] In 2015, Google Photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[129] and in 2018, this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[130] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[131] In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[132] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[133] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that \"[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\"[134] Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.[135] It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.[136] By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.[137] Learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[138] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[139][140] Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[141] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and/or evasion via adversarial machine learning.[142] Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and well-visible \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed and/or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.[143][144][145] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[146] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).[147] Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[148] For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names.[126] Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.[149][150] Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in \"disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities\" after being trained with historical crime data.[129] While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.[151] In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, \"female faculty merely make up 16.1%\" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.[152] Furthermore, among the group of \"new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,\" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.[152] AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information. These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning.[153] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[154][155] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.[156] This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.[157] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.[158] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[159] OpenAI estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[160][161] A physical neural network or Neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse. \"Physical\" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.[162][163] Embedded Machine Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers.[164][165][166] Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing, henceforth, reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data, and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties, personal data and business secrets. Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration,[167][168] using approximate computing,[169] optimization of machine learning models and many more.[170][171] Pruning, Quantization, Knowledge Distillation, Low-Rank Factorization, Network Architecture Search (NAS) & Parameter Sharing are few of the techniques used for optimization of machine learning models.

Internet Lists Social media are interactive technologies that facilitate the creation, sharing and aggregation of content (such as ideas, interests, and other forms of expression) amongst virtual communities and networks.[1][2] Common features include:[2] Online platforms that enable users to create and share content and participate in social networking.[2][3][4] User-generated content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through online interactions.[2][3] Service-specific profiles that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.[2][5] Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.[2][5] The term social in regard to media suggests platforms enable communal activity. Social media can enhance and extend human networks.[6] Users access social media through web-based apps or custom apps on mobile devices. These interactive platforms allow individuals, communities, and organizations to share, co-create, discuss, participate in, and modify user-generated or self-curated content.[7][5][1] Social media is used to document memories, learn, and form friendships.[8] They may be used to promote people, companies, products, and ideas.[8] Social media can be used to consume, publish, or share news. Popular social media platforms with over 100 million registered users include Twitter, Facebook, WeChat, ShareChat, Instagram, Pinterest, QZone, Weibo, VK, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, Threads and LinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube, Letterboxd, QQ, Quora, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord, and TikTok. Wikis are examples of collaborative content creation.[according to whom?] Social media outlets differ from old media (e.g. newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality,[9] reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.[10] Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (many sources to many receivers) while traditional media operate under a monologic (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monologic#English) transmission model (one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city.[11] Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers, including exposure to inappropriate content, exploitation by adults, sleep problems, attention problems, feelings of exclusion, and various mental health maladies.[12][13] Social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy. The PLATO system was launched in 1960 at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation. It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowdsourced online newspaper, and blog and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. ARPANET, which came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the network etiquette (or \"netiquette\") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[14] ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1990s.[15] Usenet, conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, was the first open social media app, established in 1980. A precursor of the electronic bulletin board system (BBS), known as Community Memory, appeared by 1973. Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which launched on February 16, 1978. Before long, most major US cities had more than one BBS, running on TRS-80, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, IBM PC, Commodore 64, Sinclair, and others. CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s. Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.[16] Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee integrated HTML hypertext software with the Internet, creating the World Wide Web. This breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs, list servers, and email services. Message forums migrated to the web, and evolved into Internet forums, supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously. These early text-based systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century, aided by digital cameras and camera phones.[17] The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web 2.0.[6] Social media started in the mid-1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities, Classmates.com, and SixDegrees.com.[18] While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time, SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously. It boasted features like profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations, making it \"the very first social networking site\".[18][19] The platform's name was inspired by the \"six degrees of separation\" concept, which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else.[20] In the early 2000s, social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace, followed by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.[21] Research from 2015 reported that globally, users spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[22] likely fueled by the availability of smartphones.[23] As of 2023 as many as 4.76 billion people used social media[24] some 59% of the global population. A 2015 review identified four features unique to social media services:[2] Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.[2][3] User-generated content[2][3] User-created self profiles[2][5] Social networks formed by connections between profiles,[2][5] such as followers, groups, and lists. In 2019, Merriam-Webster defined social media as \"forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).\"[25] Social media encompasses an expanding suite of services:[26] Blogs (ex. HuffPost, Boing Boing) Business networks (ex. LinkedIn, XING) Collaborative projects (Mozilla, GitHub) Enterprise social networks (Yammer, Socialcast, Slack) Forums (Gaia Online, IGN) Microblogs (Twitter, Tumblr, Weibo) Photo sharing (Pinterest, Flickr, Photobucket) Products/services review (Amazon, Upwork) Social bookmarking (Delicious, Pinterest) Social gaming including MMORPG (Fortnite, World of Warcraft) Social network (Facebook, Instagram, Baidu Tieba, VK, QZone, ShareChat, WeChat, LINE) Video sharing (YouTube, Vimeo) Virtual worlds (Second Life, Twinity) Some services offer more than one type of service.[5] Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is distinguished by its ubiquity, since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer. Mobile services can further make use of the user's immediate location to offer information, connections, or services relevant to that location. According to Andreas Kaplan, mobile social media activities fall among four types:[27] Space-timers (location and time-sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time (posting about a traffic jam) Space-locators (only location sensitive): Posts/messages with relevance for a specific location, read later by others (e.g. a restaurant review) Quick-timers (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy (e.g. posting status updates) Slow-timers (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices (e.g. watching a video) Certain content has the potential to spread virally, an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual. One user spreads a post across their network, which leads those users to follow suit. A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours. Virality is not guaranteed; few posts make the transition. Viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns. Nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally. Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users re-share content, such as X's and Facebook's \"like\" option.[28] Bots are automated programs that operate on the internet.[29] They automate many communication tasks. This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers.[30] Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking, commenting, and following.[31] Bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing.[32] Bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis, as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions.[33] Some bots violate platforms' terms of use, which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically.[34] Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions.[35] 'Cyborgs'—either bot-assisted humans or human-assisted bots[35]—are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes, from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz.[36][37][38] A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time.[39] A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time. In other cases, cyborgs spread fake news.[35] Cyborgs may work as sock puppets, where one human pretends to be someone else, or operates multiple accounts, each pretending to be a person. A multitude of United States patents are related to social media, growing rapidly.[citation needed] As of 2020[update] (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_media&action=edit), over 5000 social media patent applications had been published in the United States.[40] Only slightly over 100 patents had been issued.[41] As an instance of technological convergence, various social media platforms adapted functionality beyond their original scope, increasingly overlapping with each other. Examples are the social hub site Facebook launching an integrated video platform in May 2007,[42] and Instagram, whose original scope was low-resolution photo sharing, introducing the ability to share quarter-minute 640×640 pixel videos[43] (late extended to a minute with increased resolution). Instagram later implemented stories (short videos self-destructing after 24 hours), a concept popularized by Snapchat, as well as IGTV, for seekable videos.[44] Stories were then adopted by YouTube.[45] X, whose original scope was text-based microblogging, later adopted photo sharing,[46] then video sharing,[47][48] then a media studio for business users, after YouTube's Creator Studio.[49] The discussion platform Reddit added an integrated image hoster replacing the external image sharing platform Imgur,[50] and then an internal video hosting service,[51] followed by image galleries (multiple images in a single post), known from Imgur.[52] Imgur implemented video sharing.[53][54] YouTube rolled out a Community feature, for sharing text-only posts and polls.[55] According to Statista, it is estimated that, in 2022, around 3.96 billion people were using social media globally. This number is up from 3.6 billion in 2020.[56] The following is a list of the most popular social networking services based on the number of active users as of January 2024[update] (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_media&action=edit) per Statista.[57] 1 Facebook 3,049 United States 2 YouTube 2,491 United States 3 WhatsApp 2,000 United States 3 Instagram 2,000 United States 5 TikTok 1,526 China 6 WeChat 1,336 China 7 Facebook Messenger 979 United States 8 Telegram 800 Russia 9 Douyin 752 China 10 Snapchat 750 United States 11 Kuaishou 685 China 12 Twitter 619 United States A 2009 study suggested that individual differences may help explain who uses social media: extraversion and openness have a positive relationship with social media, while emotional stability has a negative sloping relationship with social media.[59] A 2015 study reported that people with a higher social comparison orientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation.[60] Common Sense Media reported that children under age 13 in the United States use social networking services although many social media sites require users to be 13 or older.[61] In 2017, the firm conducted a survey of parents of children from birth to age 8 and reported that 4% of children at this age used social media sites such as Instagram, Snapchat, or (now-defunct) Musical.ly \"often\" or \"sometimes\".[62] Their 2019 survey surveyed Americans ages 8–16 and reported that about 31% of children ages 8–12 use social media.[63] In that survey, teens aged 16–18 were asked when they started using social media. the median age was 14, although 28% said they started to use it before reaching 13. Social media played a role in communication during the COVID-19 pandemic.[64] In June 2020, a survey by Cartoon Network and the Cyberbullying Research Center surveyed Americans tweens (ages 9–12) and reported that the most popular application was YouTube (67%).[65] (as age increased, tweens were more likely to have used social media apps and games.) Similarly, Common Sense Media's 2020 survey of Americans ages 13–18 reported that YouTube was the most popular (used by 86% of 13- to 18-year-olds).[66] As children aged, they increasingly utilized social media services and often used YouTube to consume content.

During these days, people are forced to stay at home and the social media have connected and supported awareness and pandemic updates.\"[67] Healthcare workers and systems became more aware of social media as a place people were getting health information: \"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems.\"[68] This also led to the spread of disinformation. On December 11, 2020, the CDC put out a \"Call to Action: Managing the Infodemic\".[69] Some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on their Twitter data:[70] \"Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care.\"[70] However others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction, as it became an increasingly important context and therefore \"source of social validation and reinforcement\" and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful.[71] Governments may use social media to (for example):[72] inform their opinions to public interact with citizens foster citizen participation further open government analyze/monitor public opinion and activities educate the public about risks and public health.[73] Social media has been used extensively in civil and criminal investigations.[74] It has also been used to search for missing persons.[75] Police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public, publicize police activity, and burnish law enforcement's image;[76][77] conversely, video footage of citizen-documented police brutality and other misconduct has sometimes been posted to social media.[77] In the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identifies and track individuals via social media, and has apprehended some people via social media-based sting operations.[78] U.S. Customs and Border Protection (also known as CPB) and the United States Department of Homeland Security use social media data as influencing factors during the visa process, and monitor individuals after they have entered the country.[79] CPB officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border, searching both citizens and non-citizens without first obtaining a warrant.[79] As social media gained momentum among the younger generations, governments began using it to improve their image, especially among the youth. In January 2021, Egyptian authorities were reported to be using Instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program. The program was designed to revamp Egypt's image and to counter the bad press Egypt had received because of the country's human rights record. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in similar programs.[80] Similarly, Dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism. However, Dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities, or to criticize the city, politics or religion. The content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays Dubai in a negative light.[81] Many businesses use social media for marketing, branding,[82] advertising, communication, sales promotions, informal employee-learning/organizational development, competitive analysis, recruiting, relationship management/loyalty programs,[27] and e-Commerce. Companies use social-media monitoring tools to monitor, track, and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing, sales and other programs. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, tools. Social media offers information on industry trends. Within the finance industry, companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment. These range from marketing financial products, market trends, and as a tool to identify insider trading.[83] To exploit these opportunities, businesses need guidelines for use on each platform.[3] Business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence. Instead, it makes its case by participating in the \"conversation\".[84] Business uses social media[85] on a customer-organizational level; and an intra-organizational level. Social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, by highlighting successes, and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily available/known.[86] Social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections with customers. Social media marketing can be divided into paid media, earned media, and owned media.[87] Using paid social media firms run advertising on a social media platform. Earned social media appears when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it. Owned social media is the platform markets itself by creating/promoting content to its users.[88] Primary uses are to create brand awareness, engage customers by conversation (e.g., customers provide feedback on the firm) and providing access to customer service.[89] Social media's peer-to-peer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers, since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company.[90] Social media personalities, often referred to as \"influencers\", are Internet celebrities who are sponsored by marketers to promote products and companies online. Research reports that these endorsements attract the attention of users who have not settled on which products/services to buy,[91] especially younger consumers.[92] The practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as influencer marketing. In 2013, the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag #spon or #ad when endorsing. The US Federal Trade Commission issued similar guidelines.[93] Social media platforms also enable targeting specific audiences with advertising. Users of social media can share, and comment on the advertisement, turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers.[94] Targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users.[3] Companies can use humor (such as shitposting) to poke fun at competitors.[95] Advertising can even inspire fanart which can engage new audiences.[96] Hashtags (such as #ejuice and #eliquid) are one way to target interested users.[97] User content can trigger peer effects, increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement. A 2012 study focused on this communication reported that communication among peers can affect purchase intentions: direct impact through encouraging conformity, and an indirect impact by increasing product engagement. This study claimed that peer communication about a product increased product engagement.[98] Social media have a range of uses in politics.[99] Politicians use social media to spread their messages and influence voters.[100] Dounoucos et al. reported that Twitter use by candidates was unprecedented during the US 2016 election.[101][102] The public increased its reliance on social-media sites for political information.[101] In the European Union, social media amplified political messages.[103] Foreign-originated social-media campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country.[104][105] Social media was influential in the Arab Spring in 2011.[106][107][108][109] However, debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this.[110] Activists have used social media to report the abuse of human rights in Bahrain. They publicized the brutality of government authorities, who they claimed were detaining, torturing and threatening individuals. Conversely, Bahrain's government used social media to track and target activists. The government stripped citizenship from over 1,000 activists as punishment.[111] Militant groups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool.[112] Islamic State (also known as ISIS) used social media. In 2014, #AllEyesonISIS went viral on Arabic X.[113][114] Social media use in hiring refers to the examination by employers of job applicants' (public) social media profiles as part of the hiring assessment. For example, the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees and as a tool for talent acquisition.[115] This practice raises ethical questions. Employers and recruiters note that they have access only to information that applicants choose to make public. Many Western-European countries restrict employer's use of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin protect applicants and employees from surrendering usernames and passwords for social media accounts.[citation needed] Use of social media as caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media. A 2013 survey of 17,000 young people in six countries found that one in ten people aged 16 to 34 claimed to have been rejected for a job because of social media activity.[116][117] Scientists use social media to share their scientific knowledge and research on platforms such as ResearchGate, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, and Academia.edu.[118] The most common platforms are X and blogs. The use of social media reportedly has improved the interaction between scientists, reporters, and the general public.[citation needed] Over 495,000 opinions were shared on X related to science between September 1, 2010, and August 31, 2011.[119] Science related blogs respond to and motivate public interest in learning, following, and discussing science. Posts can be written quickly and allow the reader to interact in real time with authors.[120] One study in the context of climate change reported that climate scientists and scientific institutions played a minimal role in online debate, exceeded by nongovernmental organizations.[121] Academicians use social media activity to assess academic publications,[122] to measure public sentiment,[123] identify influencer accounts,[124] or crowdsource ideas or solutions.[125] Social media such as Facebook, X are also combined to predict elections via sentiment analysis.[126] Additional social media (e.g. YouTube, Google Trends) can be combined to reach a wider segment of the voting population, minimise media-specific bias, and inexpensively estimate electoral predictions which are on average half of a percentage point off the real vote share.[127] In some places, students have been forced to surrender their social media passwords to school administrators.[128] Few laws protect student's social media privacy. Organizations such as the ACLU call for more privacy protection. They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to resist.[129] Colleges and universities may access applicants' internet services including social media profiles as part of their admissions process. According to Kaplan, Inc, a corporation that provides higher education preparation, in 2012 27% of admissions officers used Google to learn more about an applicant, with 26% checking Facebook.[130] Students whose social media pages include questionable material may be disqualified from admission processes. \"One survey in July 2017, by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers, reported that 11 percent of respondents said they had refused to admit an applicant based on social media content. This includes 8 percent of public institutions, where the First Amendment applies. The survey reported that 30 percent of institutions acknowledged reviewing the personal social media accounts of applicants at least some of the time.\"[131] Social media comments and images have been used in court cases including employment law, child custody/child support, and disability claims. After an Apple employee criticized his employer on Facebook, he was fired. When the former employee sued Apple for unfair dismissal, the court, after examining the employee's Facebook posts, reported in favor of Apple, stating that the posts breached Apple's policies.[132] After a couple broke up, the man posted song lyrics \"that talked about fantasies of killing the rapper's ex-wife\" and made threats. A court reported him guilty.[132][clarification needed] In a disability claims case, a woman who fell at work claimed that she was permanently injured; the employer used her social media posts to counter her claims.[132] Courts do not always admit social media evidence, in part, because screenshots can be faked or tampered with.[133] Judges may consider emojis into account to assess statements made on social media; in one Michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment, the judge disagreed, noting that an emoji after the comment that indicated that it was a joke.[133] In a 2014 case in Ontario against a police officer regarding alleged assault of a protester during the G20 summit, the court rejected the Crown's application to use a digital photo of the protest that was anonymously posted online, because it included no metadata verifying its provenance.[133] Social media as a news source is the use of online social media platforms rather than moreover traditional media platforms to obtain news. Just as television turned a nation of people who listened to media content into watchers of media content in the 1950s to the 1980s, the emergence of social media has created a nation of media content creators. Almost half of Americans use social media as a news source, according to the Pew Research Center.[134] As a participatory platform that allows for user-generated content[135][136] and sharing content within one's own virtual network,[137][135] using social media as a news source allows users to engage with news in a variety of ways,[138] including: Consume news Discover news Share or repost news Post their own photos, videos, or reports of news (i.e., engage in citizen or participatory journalism) Comment on news Using social media as a news source has become an increasingly more popular way for old and young adults alike to obtain information. There are ways that social media positively affects the world of news and journalism but it is important to acknowledge that there are also ways in which social media has a negative effect on the news that people consume such as false news, biased news, and disturbing content. Social media are used to socialize with friends and family[141] pursue romance and flirt,[141] but not all social needs can be fulfilled by social media.[142] For example, a 2003 article reported that lonely individuals are more likely to use the Internet for emotional support than others.[143] A 2018 survey from Common Sense Media reported that 40% of American teens ages 13–17 thought that social media was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important for them to connect with their friends.[144] The same survey reported that 33% of teens said social media was extremely or very important to conduct meaningful conversations with close friends, and 23% of teens said social media was extremely or very important to document and share their lives.[144] A 2020 Gallup poll reported that 53% of adult social media users in the United States thought that social media was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with people during the COVID-19 pandemic.[145] In Alone Together Sherry Turkle considered how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication.[146] She claimed that people act differently online and are less concerned about hurting others' feelings. Some online encounters can cause stress and anxiety, due to the difficulty purging online posts, fear of getting hacked, or of universities and employers exploring social media pages. Turkle speculated that many people prefer texting to face-to-face communication, which can contribute to loneliness.[146] Surveys from 2019 reported evidence among teens in the United States[144] and Mexico.[147] Some researchers reported that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocal messages correlated with less loneliness.[148] In social media \"stalking\" or \"creeping\" refers to looking at someone's \"timeline, status updates, tweets, and online bios\" to find information about them and their activities.[149] A sub-category of creeping is creeping ex-partners after a breakup.[150] Catfishing (creating a false identity) allows bad actors to exploit the lonely.[151] Self-presentation theory proposes that people consciously manage their self-image or identity related information in social contexts.[152] One aspect of social media is the time invested in customizing a personal profile.[153] Some users segment their audiences based on the image they want to present, pseudonymity and use of multiple accounts on the same platform offer that opportunity.[154] A 2016 study reported that teenage girls manipulate their self-presentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers.[155] Teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance (likes, comments, and shares). When this does not go well, self-confidence and self-satisfaction can decline.[155] A 2018 survey of American teens ages 13–17 by Common Sense Media reported that 45% said likes are at least somewhat important, and 26% at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos.[144] Some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain,[156] and some may resort to online bullying.[157] according to a 2016 study, users' reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers.[158] A 2016 review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos, self-comparison, disappointment, and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved.[159] One 2016 study reported that Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior.[160] People portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way.[155] However, upon seeing one person's curated persona, other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. One 2017 study reported that problematic social media use (i.e., feeling addicted to social media) was related to lower life satisfaction and self-esteem.[161] Studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health.[162][163] In one study, women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction; while men reported them as the second biggest factor.[164] While monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media, the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with one's own may increase their impact. A 2021 study reported that 87% of women and 65% of men compared themselves to others on social media.[165] Efforts to combat such negative effects focused promoting body positivity. In a related study, women aged 18–30 were reported posts that contained side-by-side images of women in the same clothes and setting, but one image was enhanced for Instagram, while the other was an unedited, \"realistic\" version. Women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction.[166] Social media can offer a support system for adolescent health, because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant.[167] For example, in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing obesity treatment, participants' claimed that social media allowed them to access personalized weight-loss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity.[168][169] While social media can provide health information, it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information.[169] The National Eating Disorders Association reported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content.[169][170] Health literacy offers skills to allow users to spot/avoid such content. Efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success.[171] Social media such as pro-anorexia sites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging health-related behaviors through social media, especially among adolescents.[172][173][174] During the coronavirus pandemic, inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media.[175] Topics subject to distortion included treatments, avoiding infection, vaccination, and public policy. Simultaneously, governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy.[176] Heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories, leading to worse mental health[177] and less compliance with public health recommendations.[178] Social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addiction-related behaviors, with studies report that excessive use can lead to addiction-like symptoms. These symptoms include compulsive checking, mood modification, and withdrawal when not using social media, which can result in decreased face-to-face social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness.[179] A 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media. It concluded that blue light from computer/phone displays—and the frequency rather than the duration of time spent, predicted disturbed sleep, termed \"obsessive 'checking'\".[183] The association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults.[184] A recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance. The median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61. Females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance.[185] Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones, and this left them tired and unfocused in school.[186] A 2011 study reported that time spent on Facebook was negatively associated with GPA, but the association with sleep disturbance was not established.[187] One studied effect of social media is 'Facebook depression', which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media.[8] This may lead to reclusiveness, which can increase loneliness and low self-esteem.[8] Social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling.[184] Studies report children's self-esteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments. This affected self-perception.[188] A 2017 study of almost 6,000 adolescent students reported that those who self-reported addiction-like symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low self-esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms.[189] A second emotional effect is social media burnout, defined as ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization. Ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media. Emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media. Depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media. The three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media.[190] A third emotional effect is \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO), which is the \"pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.\"[191] It is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media.[191] Social media can also offer support as Twitter has done for the medical community.[192] X facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students, while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes, comments, and posts.[193] Access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected, after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones.[194] Some commentators refer to social media as 'anti-social media' when describing its social impact.[195][196] The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet.[197][198] The digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources. In the Information Age, people without access to the Internet and other technology are at a disadvantage, for they are unable or less able to connect with others, find and apply for jobs, shop, and learn.[197][199] Many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content.[204][205] Because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users' political preferences, one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure. Political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes. Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them.[206] Aviv Ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content,[207] but could be designed to reduce polarization instead.[208] In 2017, Facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button, which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity, misinformation and low-quality news.[209] Some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts.[210][211][207] Some advocate for media literacy as a solution.[212] Others argue that less social media,[206] or more local journalism[213][214][215] could help address political polarization. A 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes.[216] Stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease.[217] Elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media.[218] Social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication, despite different ways of communicating in various cultures.[219] Social media has affected the way youth communicate, by introducing new forms of language.[220] Novel acronyms save time, as illustrated by \"LOL\", which is the ubiquitous shortcut for \"laugh out loud\". The hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others. Hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement, mark content for future use, and allow other users to contribute to a discussion.[221] For some young people, social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications, made worse by pandemic isolation, delaying the development of conversation and other social skills.[222] What is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media.[223] The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that bullying, the making of non-inclusive friend groups, and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying, privacy issues, and sending sexual images or messages. Sexting and revenge porn became rampant, particularly among minors, with legal implications and resulting trauma risk.[224][225][226][227] However, adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online.[228] Social media, can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch, making more friends, and engaging in community activities.[8] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Social_media&action=edit&section=). (July 2024) In July 2014, in response to WikiLeaks' release of a secret suppression order made by the Victorian Supreme Court, media lawyers were quoted in the Australian media to the effect that \"anyone who tweets a link to the WikiLeaks report, posts it on Facebook, or shares it in any way online could also face charges\".[229] On 27 July 2020, in Egypt, two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting TikTok videos, which the government claimed as \"violating family values\".[230] In the 2014 Thai coup d'état, the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison.[citation needed] Historically, platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented. They set rules for what was allowable, decided which content to promote and which to ignore. The US enacted the Communications Decency Act in 1996. Section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" (47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)). In 2024, legislation was enacted in Florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts, and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14, and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval.[231][232] The European Union initially took a similar approach.[233] However, in 2020, the European Commission presented two legislative proposals: The Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Both proposals were enacted in July 2022. The DSA entered into force on 17 February 2024, the DMA in March 2024.[234] This legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives, articulated by MEPs: \"What is illegal offline must also be illegal online\".[235] \"Very large online platforms\" must therefore, among other things delete illegal content (propaganda, election interference, hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse) and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a \"high level of privacy, security and protection of minors\", by prohibiting advertising based on personal data, designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment, and not use sensitive personal data such as race, gender and religion to target advertising.[236] delete illegal content (propaganda, election interference, hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse) and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a \"high level of privacy, security and protection of minors\", by prohibiting advertising based on personal data, designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment, and not use sensitive personal data such as race, gender and religion to target advertising.[236] Violators could face a complete ban in Europe or fines of up to 6% of global sales. Such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers.[237] Enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance.[238] The DSA allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction. According to Patrick Breyer from the German Pirate Party, a problem could arise from the Hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of Victor Orban, as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied EU-wide.[239] 2018 Nobel Laureate Paul Romer[240] advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms.[237] Similar to a carbon tax – negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms.[241] Assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities, the revenue raised could be used to address them. However, consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms, nor to craft a tax, . Another proposal is to invoke competition law.[242] The idea is to restrict the platforms' market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law. This would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines. In a 2024 opinion piece, Megan Moreno and Jenny Radesky, professors of pediatrics, wrote about the need for \"nuanced\" policy.[243] They regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful. They commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions \"may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages\".[244] In June 2024, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people.[245] The business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers. Platforms provide access to data about each user, which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them. This strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible, increasing the number of ads that they see. Platforms such as X add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues.[246] The enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism, debate, and controversy. Criticisms include platform capabilities, content moderation and reliability,[247] impact on concentration, mental health,[248] content ownership, and the meaning of interactions, and poor cross-platform interoperability,[249] decrease in face-to-face interactions, cyberbullying, sexual predation, particularly of children, and child pornography.[250][251] In 2007 Andrew Keen wrote, \"Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated. Under these rules, the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering.\"[252] Social media has become a regular source of news and information. A 2021 Pew Research Center poll reported roughly 70% of users regularly get news from social media,[4] despite the presence of fake news and misinformation. Platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy, and many do not vet content at all, although in some cases, content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced.[253][254][255] Content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance, responding instead to the contents' virality. In 2018, researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70% faster than truthful news on X.[7] Social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users.[10] Some platforms attempt to discover and block bots, with limited success.[11] Fake news seems to receive more user engagement, possibly because it is relatively novel, engaging users' curiosity and increasing spread.[23] Fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event, before conventional media are prepared to publish.[20][16] Social media mining is the process of obtaining data from user-generated content on social media in order to extract actionable patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information. Mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research. The term is an analogy to the process of mining for minerals. Mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals; likewise, social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage, online behaviour, content sharing, connections between individuals, buying behaviour. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies, introduce programs, products, processes or services. Social media mining uses concepts from computer science, data mining, machine learning, and statistics. Mining is based on social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, optimization and mathematics. It attempts to formally represent, measure and model patterns from social media data.[256] In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations began mining to learn about customers, clients and others. Platforms such as Google, Facebook (partnered with Datalogix and BlueKai) conduct mining to target users with advertising.[257] Scientists and machine learning researchers extract insights and design product features.[258] Users may not understand how platforms use their data.[259] Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements without reading them, leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users' privacy. Malcolm Gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated. He concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves, that expression likely has no impact beyond social media. What he called \"high-risk activism\" involves strong relationships, coordination, commitment, high risks, and sacrifice.[261] Gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that \"social networks are effective at increasing participation—by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires.\"[261] According to him, \"Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice.\"[261] Disputing Gladwell's theory, a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity.[262] Social media content is generated by users. However, content ownership is defined by the Terms of Service to which users agree. Platforms control access to the content, and may make it available to third parties.[263] Although platform's terms differ, generally they all give permission to utilize users' copyrighted works at the platform's discretion.[264] After its acquisition by Facebook in 2012, Instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users.[265][266] It then reversed these changes, with then-CEO Kevin Systrom promising to update the terms of service.[267][268] Privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data. Information is captured without the user's knowing consent. Data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes.[269][263] Information may be offered for third party use. Young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators.[270] While social media users claim to want to keep their data private, their behavior does not reflect that concern, as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles. In addition, platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles. This data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising.[271] A 2014 Pew Research Center survey reported that 91% of Americans \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used. Some 80% of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms, and 64% said the government should do more to regulate advertisers.[272] In 2019, UK legislators criticized Facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data.[273] In 2019 the Pentagon issued guidance to the military, Coast Guard and other government agencies that identified \"the potential risk associated with using the TikTok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information.\"[274] As a result, the military, Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and Department of Homeland Security banned the installation and use of TikTok on government devices.[275] In 2020 The US government attempted to ban TikTok and WeChat from the States over national security concerns. However, a federal court blocked the move.[276] In 2024, the US Congress passed a low directing TikTok's parent company ByteDance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the US. The company sued, challenging the constitutionality of the ban.[277] Internet addiction \"disorder\" (IAD), also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use, is a problematic compulsive use of the internet, particularly on social media, that impairs an individual's function over a prolonged period of time. Young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder,[278] with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online.[279] Some experience health consequences from loss of sleep[280] as they stay up to continue scrolling, chatting, and gaming.[281] Excessive Internet use is not recognized as a disorder by the World Health Organization, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).[282] However, gaming disorder appears in the ICD-11.[283] Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity, or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. Definitions are not standardized or agreed upon, complicating the development of evidence-based recommendations. Users under 30 access the Internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse.[284] In 2011 the term \"Facebook addiction disorder\" (FAD) emerged.[285] FAD is characterized by compulsive use of Facebook. A 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use and narcissism, reporting \"FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms)\".[286][287] In 2020, the documentary The Social Dilemma, reported concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social media's pursuit of addictive use. For example, when a user has not visited Facebook for some time, the platform varies its notifications, attempting to lure them back. It also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality.[288] Whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous.[291] A study of Americans aged 12–15, reported that teenagers who used social media over three hours/day doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety.[292] Platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content. A 2023 study of Australian youth reported that 57% had seen disturbingly violent content, while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images.[293] Further, youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullying.[citation needed] As result, phones have been banned from some schools, and some schools in the US have blocked social media websites.[294] Social media often features in political struggles. In some countries, Internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in Turkey after the Taksim Gezi Park protests. Both X and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A law granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (TİB) personnel. The TİB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order.[295] Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of X was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.[296] Internet censorship in the United States is the suppression of information published or viewed on the Internet in the United States. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal, state, and local government censorship. Free speech protections allow little government-mandated Internet content restrictions. However, the Internet is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.[297] Gambling, cyber security, and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the US[297] Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred, often after lengthy legal battles.[298] However, the government has exerted pressure indirectly. With the exception of child pornography, content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to remove/suppress content, following state encouragement or the threat of legal action.[299][297] While the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable, open source protocols such as ActivityPub have been adopted by platforms such as Mastodon, GNU social, Diaspora, and Friendica. They operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteer-operated servers, called the Fediverse. However, in 2019, Mastodon blocked Gab from connecting to it, claiming that it spread violent, right-wing extremism.[305] In December 2019, X CEO Jack Dorsey advocated an \"open and decentralized standard for social media\". He joined Bluesky to bring it to reality.[306] Deplatforming, also called no-platforming, is a form of Internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their information/ideas. This typically involves suspension, outright bans, or reducing spread (shadow banning).[307][308] A number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational, emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on.[311] Zack Beauchamp of Vox calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats.[312] The Economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats.[313] Informed dialogue, a shared sense of reality, mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media.[314] Political polarization can be one byproduct.[315][316][317] This has implications for the likelihood of political violence.[318][206] Siva Vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing anti-trust laws.[195] Andrew Leonard describes Pol.is as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies, citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus.[319][320] According to LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media,[321] the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities, corporations, and governments, but also extremist groups.[322] The use of social media by ISIS and Al-Qaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers. Social media platforms and encrypted-messaging applications have been used to recruit members, both locally and internationally.[323] Platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content. Extreme nationalist groups, and more prominently, US right-wing extremists have used similar online tactics. As many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech, several platforms became popular among right-wing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events; these application became known as \"Alt-tech\". Platforms such as Telegram, Parler, and Gab were used during the January 6 United States Capitol attack, to coordinate attacks.[324] Members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives; some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians.[325] Social media content, persists unless the user deletes it. After a user dies, unless the platform is notified, their content remains.[326] Each platform has created guidelines for this situation.[327] In most cases on social media, the platforms require a next-of-kin to prove that the user is deceased, and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a 'legacy' status. X[328] The company works with an immediate family member to deactivate the account. Additionally, X will not give the account to any other person, regardless of the relationship. Facebook Users have the option of having their account permanently deleted after death. Users can identify a 'legacy contact' who would take over the account after. Instagram[329] Users can have the account memorialized or deleted with proof of death. LinkedIn[330] A family member can request that the account be deleted. The family member must identify the account, submit proof of relationship, the user's email address, date of death, a link to the obituary, and the name of the last company the deceased worked for. Pinterest Must email the company with the URL of the account along with a death certificate or a link to the obituary, as well as proof of relationship to the deceased. YouTube[331] A representative can close the account, transfer payments from the account to an immediate family member and legal representative of the user's estate, and can provide the data in the account to a family member.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) publishes a recommendation entitled Notation for national and international telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and Web addresses. Recommendation E.123 specifies the format of telephone numbers assigned to telephones and similar communication endpoints in national telephone numbering plans. In examples, a numeric digit is used only if the digit is the same in every number, and letters to illustrate groups. X is used as a wildcard character to represent any digit in lists of numbers. All telephone numbers in Djibouti have eight digits. Fixed line numbers start with 21 or 27, then a fixed line locality code, followed by four digits. Mobile numbers start with 77, then a mobile line locality code, followed by four digits. With the country code of Djibouti (253), the international format is \"+253 XX YY ZZZZ\". All telephone numbers in Morocco have ten digits (initial 0 plus nine numbers). Landline numbers start with 05, followed by two digits for the regional area RR, then two digits for the local area LL, then 4 digits for the subscriber number XX XX: (\"05 RR LL XX XX\" or \"05RR LL XX XX\"). Mobile numbers start with 06 or 07, followed by the subscriber number (\"06 XX XX XX XX\" or \"07 XX XX XX XX\"). The country code for Morocco is 212, so the format becomes \"+212 Y XX XX XX XX\" or \"+212 YXX XX XX XX\", also \"+212 YXX-XXXXXX\" as well, where Y is 5 for landlines or 6/7 for mobile. Free calling numbers (green numbers) or call center numbers start with 080 or 090. Telephone numbers in Kenya use a 9-digit format. The nine digits used for local calls start with a \"0\" (trunk prefix) for domestic calls, followed by the 3-digit area/provider code and the final six digits (07XX XXX XXX). The international code for Kenya is \"+254\". South Africa uses 10-digit dialling, which has been required since 16 January 2007. The ten digits used for local calls (AAA XXX XXXX or 0AA XXX XXXX) consist of a 3-digit area/type code (the first digit in the area/type code is a trunk prefix) followed by seven digits. All area codes, including mobile numbers, start with a \"0\" (trunk prefix) for domestic calls. When dialing from another country, the country code for South Africa is \"27\", with the rest of the digits excluding the \"0\" trunk prefix (+27 AA XXX XXXX). Telephone numbers in China have 10 or 11 digits (excluding an initial zero which is required at times) and fall in at least four distinct categories: Landlines: In China, the length of phone numbers varies from city to city. It is usually written as (0XXX) YYY YYYY (For landlines registered in large metropolises, it is written in the format (0XXX) YYYY YYYY), where 0 is the trunk code, XXX is the area code (2 or 3 digits) and YYYY YYYY is the local number (7 or 8 digits). For example, (0755) XXXX YYYY indicates a Shenzhen number. XXXXYYYY is dialed locally, 0755 XXXX YYYY is dialed in other areas inside the country, while, for international calls to Shenzhen, the 0 is dropped and is written +86 755 XXXX YYYY. Mobiles: The 11-digit code is always written in full in the whole China e.g. 1WX YYYY ZZZZ. Each WX is assigned to a service provider while W is usually '3' through '9'. The remaining eight digits are the subscriber number. Toll Free: These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 800 or 400. 800 (toll-free) are accessible only when called from landline phones, while 400 (shared toll) are accessible from all phones. 400 XXX XXXX or 800 XXXX XXXX. Service numbers: These are usually 3- to 5-digit numbers (e.g. Police is 110) used to access an emergency service (Fire 119, Ambulance 120, Police 110, Roadside assistance 12122) or a value-added service. Every number, except special service numbers, is an 8-digit number; they are grouped as XXXX YYYY. There are no area codes. Telephone numbers in India have ten digits (excluding an initial zero which is required at times) and fall into at least four distinct categories: Landlines: Written as AAA-BBBBBBB, where AAA is the Subscriber Trunk Dialing code (long-distance code) and BBBBBBB is the phone number. The total length of the Subscriber Trunk Dialing code and the phone number is ten digits. The Subscriber Trunk Dialing code can have from two digits (11 or 011) up to four digits. Mobiles: Written as AAAAA-BBBBB for ease of remembering (though the prefix is either 2-digits or 4-digits in the numbering plan). Mobile numbers which are not local need to be prefixed by a 0 while dialing, or by +91 (91 is the country code for India). A mobile number written as +91-AAAAA BBBBB is valid throughout India, and in other countries where the + is recognized as a prefix to the country code. Since 2015, calls from mobile phones to any other mobiles do not need to prefix with a 0. However, calls from landlines to non-local mobile numbers need to be prefixed with 0. Toll Free: These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 1-800. Sometimes they are accessible (or are toll-free) only when called from the government-owned telephone corporation, BSNL/MTNL. Service numbers: These are usually three or four digit numbers (e.g. Police is 100) used to access an emergency service (Fire, Ambulance, Police, Roadside assistance) or a value-added service. All telephone numbers in Iran have 11 digits (initial 0 and ten digits). The first two or three digits after the zero are the area code. The possibilities are: (0xx) xxxx xxxx (for landlines), 09xx xxx xxxx (for cellphones) and 099xx xxx xxx (for MVNO). When making a call within the same landline area code, initial 0 plus the area code must be omitted. An example for calling telephones in the city of Tehran is as follows: xxxx xxxx (within Tehran, via a landline) 021 xxxx xxxx (Outside Tehran, or via a cellphone) +98 21 xxxx xxxx (outside Iran) An example for mobile numbers is as follows: 09xx xxx xxxx (in Iran) +98 9xx xxx xxxx (outside Iran) The traditional convention for phone numbers is (0AA) NXX-XXXX, where 0AA is the area code and NXX-XXXX is the subscriber number. This number format is very similar to the North American numbering plan, but the country has a trunk code of 0 instead of 1, so international callers (using +81) do not have to dial the trunk code 0 when calling to Japan. Telephone numbers had nine digits in Tokyo and Osaka until the late 1990s, when a seventh digit was added to the subscriber number. Densely populated areas have shorter area codes, while rural areas have longer area codes, but the last two digits of a five-digit area code (including the first zero) may also be the first two digits of the subscriber number. Area codes increase from north to south, except in areas such as the western Hokuriku region and the prefecture of Okinawa, where area codes increase from west to east or south to north. Some telephone numbers deviate from this rule: Toll-free dialing and Navi Dial operations (0120-XX-XXXX, 0570-XX-XXXX, or 0800-XX-XXXX), where XX-XXXX is the subscriber number The area code 050 uses an 11 digit phone number (050-XXXX-XXXX), where XXXX-XXXX is the subscriber number 110 and 119 are examples of three digit emergency numbers All area codes including mobile start with a \"0\" (trunk prefix) for domestic calls. If you are dialing from another country the international calling code for Malaysia is \"60\" which may be confusing; do not dial an extra \"0\" before the rest of the digits. For fixed line and mobile phone numbers, a dash is written in between the area/mobile code and the subscriber number, with an optional space before the last four digits of the subscriber number. For example, a fixed line number in Kuala Lumpur is written as 03-XXXX YYYY or 03-XXXXYYYY, while a fixed line number in Kota Kinabalu is written as 088-XX YYYY or 088-XXYYYY. A typical mobile phone number is written as 01M-XXX YYYY or 01M-XXXYYYY. Toll-free and local charge numbers are written as 1-800-XX-YYYY and 1-300-XX-YYYY respectively, while premium rate numbers are written as 600-XX-YYYY. Telephone numbers in Pakistan have two parts. Area codes in Pakistan have from two to five digits; the smaller the city, the longer the prefix. All the large cities have two-digit codes. Smaller towns have a six digit number. Large cities have seven-digit numbers. Azad Jammu and Kashmir has five digit numbers. On 1 July 2009, telephone numbers in Karachi and Lahore were changed from seven digits to eight digits. This was accomplished by adding the digit \"9\" to the beginning of any phone number that started with a \"9\" (government and semi-government connections), and adding the digit \"3\" to any phone numbers that did not start with the number \"9\".[1] It is common to write phone numbers as (0xx) yyyyyyy, where xx is the area code. The 0 prefix is for trunk (long-distance) dialing from within the country. International callers should dial +92 xx yyyyyyyy. All mobile phone codes have four digits, and start with 03xx. All mobile numbers have seven digits, and denote the mobile provider on a nationwide basis and not geographic location. Thus all Telenor numbers (for example) nationwide carry mobile code 0345 etc. Universal access number 111 xxx xxx Emergency Service Numbers 1xx 1xxx Premium Rate services: 0900 xxxxx Toll free numbers (For callers within Pakistan): 0800 xxxxx Landline numbers are eleven digits long[2] and written as +63 (XX) YYY ZZZZ for international callers. For domestic calls, the country code (+63) is omitted and a trunk prefix (0) is placed. For local calls, both the trunk prefix (0) and the area code are omitted. Mobile numbers are twelve digits long[3] and written as +63 (XXX) YYY ZZZZ or 0 (XXX) YYY ZZZZ. In Singapore, every phone number is written as +65-XXXX-YYYY or +65 XXXX YYYY. Mobile phones starts with 8/9, landline phone numbers starts with 6 while VOIP numbers starts with 3. Subscriber numbers have eight digits and there are no area codes. Except for short codes and emergency numbers, all telephone numbers in Sri Lanka have ten digits (initial 0 + nine numbers). Landline phone numbers begin with the area code, then one digit for the operator code, then six digits for the primary telephone number. Format: (XXX Y ZZZZZZ) where: \"xxx\" denotes the area code. All area codes begin with the number 0. The operator code for fixed (landline) numbers is \"y\". \"zzzzzz\" denotes the primary telephone number, which has six digits. Mobile numbers start with the mobile operator code (which begins from 07X, followed by seven digits for the main telephone number). Format: (XXX ZZZZZZZ) where: When dialing a mobile number, \"xxx\" represents the mobile operator code. All mobile operator codes begin with the number 07. \"zzzzzzz\" represents the main telephone number of seven digits. The country code for Sri Lanka is 94, so the format becomes \"+94 XX Y ZZZZZZ\" for landlines and the format becomes \"+94 XX ZZZZZZZ\" for mobile numbers.[4] South Korean phone numbers can be as short as seven digits and as long as 11 digits, because, when making a local call (i.e. in the same city), there is no need to dial the area code. South Korean area codes are assigned based on city. Landline home numbers are usually written as: 0XX-XXX-XXXX or (0XX) XXX-XXXX where 0XX indicates an area code. (0XX) XXX-XXX and 0XX XXX XXXX (without hyphens) are comprehensible as well. The area code may have two digits for some cities such as Seoul and Gwacheon (these two cities use the same area code) and three digits for other cities such as Incheon, Busan and most of the cities in Gyeonggi-do. The middle three-digit part is extended to four digits in many areas due to the increased number of telephone users. In the international context, 82 0XX-XXX-XXXX is commonly used as well. For international calls, \"0\" in the area code is often omitted, because it is not necessary to dial 0 from foreign countries. Therefore, it is better written as: 82-(0)XX-XXX-XXXX or 82-(0)XX-XXXX-XXXX The plus (+) sign is often added to the country code (e.g., +82 0XX-XXX-XXXX or +82-0XX-XXXX-XXXX). For mobile numbers, 016490641 so on. As with the landline home numbers, the mobile numbers' middle three-digit part is extended to four digits (e.g., 016490641) due to the increased number of mobile phone users. If a number starts with 070, the number does not belong to any particular area, and is a number given by an Internet telephone service. In this case, 070 is not usually put in the brackets, neither ( ) nor ). In the business context, the numbers in the format of 15XX-XXXX and 16XX-XXXX are business representative agency or customer services. While the numbers starting with 080 (e.g., 080-XXX-XXXX) are also business-related numbers but are usually toll-free customer service centers. Also in this case, 15XX, 16XX or 070 are not put in the brackets, neither ( ) nor ). There are national telephone services which have phone numbers in the format of 1XX or 1XXX, without any area code. For example, 114 is for telephone yellow page, 119 is for fire/emergency number, 112 is for police station center, 131 is for weather forecast information, 1333 is for traffic information, and so on. The number 111 is for reporting spies, especially from North Korea. It used to be 113, so most of senior citizen still believe it is the number for reporting spies. These numbers do not need any brackets. If there are multiple numbers used for one person/entity, the symbol \"~\" is usually used to avoid repetitions. For example, if one company has three phone numbers—031-111-1111, 031-111-1112 and 031-111-1113—then they are shortened as in 031-111-1111~3. If the numbers are not consecutive, then the last digit is written together with commas. For example, if a company has three numbers—031-111-1111, 031-111-1115, 031-111-1119, then they are shortened as in 031-111-1111, 5, 9. Landline numbers in Taiwan are written with the area code in parentheses [with phone numbers total nine digits] Example: (02) XXXX YYYY for phone numbers in Taipei area. Mobile phones have 3 digit \"company code\" assigned to different mobile service carriers such as (09**) XXXXXX followed by a 6 digit phone number. (note: Mobile carriers could have multiple company codes) All numbers in Thailand, whether for landlines or mobile reception, consist of eight digits, xxxx xxxx in the government's official format. When calling domestically, landline numbers are preceded by a zero (0 xxxx xxxx, example 0 5381 0595) while mobile numbers are preceded by 0 plus one digit (0x xxxx xxxx, example 06 9756 4509). Thais often confuse the current numbering system with the old provincial area code system, which no longer exists as area codes were integrated into all phone numbers in 2005. Because of this, unofficially people often write numbers as 0xx xxx xxx (053 810 595). Calling a Thai phone number from outside Thailand, one drops the 0 and adds the 66 country code. Example +66 5381 0595.[5] Most Australian telephone numbers have ten digits, and are generally written 0A BBBB BBBB or 04XX XXX XXX for mobile telephone numbers, where 0A is the optional \"area code\" (2,3,7,8) and BBBB BBBB is the subscriber number. (http://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Numbering/Numbering-Plan/phone-number-meanings-numbering-i-acma (http://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Telco/Numbering/Numbering-Plan/phone-number-meanings-numbering-i-acma)) When the number is to be seen by an international audience, it is written +61 A BBBB BBBB or +61 4XX XXX XXX. When written for a local audience, the optional area code is omitted. The area code is often written within parentheses (0A) BBBB BBBB. Mobile numbers should never have parentheses. Ten-digit non-geographic numbers beginning with 1 are written 1X0Y BBB BBB, where X = 8 for toll free numbers, X = 3 for fixed-fee numbers and X = 9 for premium services. Six-digit non-geographic numbers are written 13 BB BB or 13B BBB; these are fixed-fee numbers. Seven-digit 180 BBBB numbers also exist. 'B's are sometimes written as letters. Almost all New Zealand telephone numbers have seven digits, with a single-digit access code and a single-digit area code for long-distance domestic calls. Traditionally, the number was given as (0A) BBB-BBBB, with the two first digits (the STD code) often omitted for local calls. The brackets and the dash are also often omitted. Mobile numbers follow the same format, but with the area code being two digits, i.e. (02M) BBB-BBBB. ( Some mobile numbers are longer: (021)02BBBBBB, (021)08BBBBBB, (020)40BBBBBB, (020) 41BBBBBB and (028) 25BBBBBB; and some are shorter: (021)3BBBBB, (021)4BBBBB, (021)5BBBBB, (021)6BBBBB, (021)7BBBBB, (021)8BBBBB and (021)9BBBBB) There are also free-phone numbers (starting with 0800 or 0508) that are given in the format 0800-AAA-AAA. It is not uncommon for the 0800 and 0508 to be enclosed in brackets, although this is not strictly correct as the brackets denote optional parts of the number, and the 0800 and 0508 is required.[6] Recently with 8 digit mobile numbers becoming more common the prefix-4 digits-4 digits format has been adopted for readability: 022 1234 5678. For international use, the prefix 64 is substituted for the leading zero, giving +64-A-BBB-BBBB for land-lines, and +64-MM-BBB-BBBB for mobile numbers. Belgian telephone numbers consist of three parts: First '0', secondly the \"zone prefix\" (A) which has one or two digits for landlines and three digits for mobile phones, and thirdly the \"subscriber's number\" (B). Land lines always have nine digits. They are prefixed by a zero, followed by the zone prefix. Depending on the length of the zone prefix, the subscriber's number consists of either 6 or 7 digits. Hence land line numbers are written either 0AA BB BB BB or 0A BBB BB BB. Mobile phone numbers always consist of ten digits. The first digit of the \"zone prefix\" of a mobile number is always '4'. Then follows 2 digits indicating to which Mobile Operator's pool the number originally belonged when it was taken into usage. The fourth digit represents a \"sub-group\" of this pool and has no additional meaning other than increasing the amount of possible numbers. The subscriber's number consists of six digits. Hence, mobile phone numbers are written 04AA BB BB BB. Sometimes, the last six digits are written in two groups of 3 digits to increase readability: 04AA BBB BBB. Numbers are sometimes written with a slash in between the zone prefix and the subscriber's number. This is the case for both land lines and mobile phone numbers. Sometimes, dots are written between the blocks of the subscriber's number. Examples: 0AA/BB BB BB, 0AA/BB.BB.BB; for mobile numbers: 04AA/BB BB BB, 04AA/BB.BB.BB or 04AA/BBB.BBB. The international code prefix for Belgium is \"32\". When dialing a number with the prefix, the 0 can be dropped, e.g.: +32 9055. Danish telephone numbers have eight digits and are normally written in four groups of two digits each, with the groups separated by spaces: AA AA AA AA, in two groups of four digits each, with the groups separated by a space: AAAA AAAA, in one group of two digits followed by two groups of three digits each, with the groups separated by spaces: AA AAA AAA, or all in one go: AAAAAAAA. The third option, AA AAA AAA is not commonly used for personal (landline or mobile) numbers, but is mostly found in corporate numbers, especially in advertizing. The standard formats – which when spoken divide numbers into ranges from 00 (zero zero) to 99 (ninety-nine) – limit the possible range of the ability to create telephone numbers that are easy to remember; dividing the numbers into groups of three expands the mnemonic possibilities. Danish emergency and service numbers have three digits and are written AAA. Danish short numbers used for text messaging services have four digits and are written AAAA. French telephone numbers have ten digits, usually written in groups of two separated by spaces, in the format 0A BB BB BB BB where 0 (the trunk prefix) was created in 1996 to be a carrier selection code, and A is the \"territorial area code\" included in the subscriber number A BB BB BB BB. Sometimes, it is also written in the format 0A.BB.BB.BB.BB using periods instead of spaces, but this is less common. The A (territorial area code) can be 1 to 5 (for geographic-based numbers, according to location: Paris/Suburbs, northwest France, northeast France, southeast France, and southwest France, respectively), and it designates nationwide numbers when it is 6 or 7 (mobile numbers), 8 (special numbers), or 9 (phone over IP over xDSL/non-geographic numbers). The numbering plan is a closed one; all digits must always be dialed. The first two or three B can designate the area (old area code) for geographic numbers, or the operator to whom the number resource belongs. There are also \"short numbers\" for emergencies (such as 112), that are written 1C or 1CC; and short numbers for special services, written 10 CC, 11C CCC, or 36 CC. 00 is the international access code. International format is +33 A BB BB BB BB where the leading trunk prefix 0 disappears (it must not be dialed from abroad). This format can be directly used in mobile phones. German telephone numbers have no fixed length for area code and subscriber number (an open numbering plan). There are many ways to format a telephone number in Germany. The most prominent is DIN 5008 but the international format E.123 and Microsoft's canonical address format are also very common. Trunk access code is 0 and international call prefix code is 00. DIN 5008 0AAAA BBBBBB DIN 5008 with Extension 0AAAA BBBBBB-XX DIN 5008 international +49 AAAA BBBBBB E.123 local (0AAAA) BBBBBB E.123 international +49 AAAA BBBBBB Microsoft +49 (AAAA) BBBBBB Old 0AAAA-BBBBBB Very old 0AAAA/BBBBBB-XX Numbers are often written in blocks of two. Example: +49 (A AA) B BB BB (Note the blocks go from right to left) The (very) old format and E.123 local form are still in use, sometimes for technical reasons. Greek telephone numbers have ten digits, and usually written AAB BBBBBBB or AAAB BBBBBB where AAB or AAAB is the 2- or 3-digit national area code plus the first digit of the subscriber number, and BBBBBBB or BBBBBB are the remaining digits of the subscriber number. The entire number must always be dialed, even if calling within the same local area; therefore, the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number. According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +30 AAB BBBBBBB or +30 AAAB BBBBBB to include the country calling code. In Hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two, except for Budapest (the capital), which has the area code 1. Subscribers' numbers have six digits in general. Numbers in Budapest and cell phone numbers have seven digits. Phone numbers in Iceland have seven digits and generally written in the form XXX XXXX or XXX-XXXX. Phone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan with varying number lengths. The area code system is similar to that in some other northern European countries. Unlike the UK, Irish fixed line numbering is divided into a number of regions which are (except Dublin) further subdivided in a hierarchical structure, with the largest town often (but not always) taking 0A1. Area codes start with a trunk prefix \"0\" and extend for up to four digits but usually 3; followed by the local phone number of up to seven digits. In industry jargon, these area codes and prefixes are referred to as NDCs (National Dialing Codes). This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents, as they include non-geographic codes. Historically, like the UK, the term STD code (Subscriber Trunk Dialling) was used. However, the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion. Dublin uses the shorter (01) code which is not further subdivided. Other cities and major towns usually have codes ending in 1. Cork for example is 021, Galway 091, Limerick 061 etc. The leading zero is always omitted when dialling from outside the country. Local phone numbers have either 5, 6 or 7-digits. In 7-digit numbering they are usually grouped as BBB BBBB, 6-digit numbers are grouped BBB BBB and 5-digit numbers are normally all grouped together BBBBB Grouping of numbers is not strictly adhered to, but usually fairly consistent. The area code should always be kept separated with a space or surrounded by brackets and not merged into the local number. The use of hyphens is discouraged, particularly on websites as it can prevent mobile browsers identifying the number as a clickable link for easier dialling. Fixed line numbers are normally presented as follows: 01 BBB BBBB for a Dublin number (7 digit) 021 BBB BBBB for a Cork number (7 digit) 064 BBB BBBB for a Killarney number (7 digit) 061 BBB BBB for a Limerick number (6 digit) 098 BBBBB for a Westport number (5 digit) 0404 BBBBB for a Wicklow number (5 digit) Area codes may also be surrounded by brackets, but this practice is falling out of use, as local dialing without the area code is optional on landlines and the area code must always be dialled on mobile phones. The Irish telecommunication regulator, ComReg has been gradually rationalising area codes by merging and extending local numbering to 7-digits in the format 0AA BBB BBBB. This is being carried out only where necessary to avoid disruption. This means that varying fixed line number lengths will continue to exist in Ireland for the foreseeable future. Mobile numbers are presented as follows: 08A BBB BBBB Brackets should not be used around the mobile prefix as it is never optional and must always be dialled, even from another phone with the same prefix. Special rate numbers, such as free phone/toll free and premium rate are usually grouped: Freephone: 1800 BB BB BB or (spoken as one-eight-hundred) Local rate: 1850 BB BB BB (eighteen-fifty) 1550 BB BB BB (read as fifteen-fifty) However, for memorability, this is not consistently adhered to. Alphanumeric characters can also be used in presenting numbers for added memorability, but it is much less common than in North America. For example: 18AA 99 TAXI Note: These special rate numbers are not reachable from outside Ireland.[7] Phone numbers in Italy have variable length. There's no well established convention about how to group digits or which symbol to use, but this is hardly an issue since all the digits are always dialed. Since 10 October 1995 (Operation Decibel) all telephone numbers in the Netherlands have ten digits (including the trunk prefix '0'). The area code ('A') is commonly separated with a dash ('-') and sometimes a space from the subscriber's number ('B'). Alternatively, the area code (including the trunk prefix) can be enclosed in parentheses. The length of the area code for landlines is either 2 or 3 digits, depending on the population density of the area. This leaves 7 or 6 digits for the subscriber's number, resulting in a format of either 0AA-BBBBBBB or 0AAA-BBBBBB. Cellphone numbers are assigned the 1-digit area code 6, leaving eight digits for the subscriber's number: 06-CBBBBBBB, where subscriber's number ('C') is neither 6 nor 7. Service numbers (area codes 800, 900, 906 and 909) have either 4 or 7 remaining digits, making them 8 or 11 digits in total: 0AAA-BBBB or 0AAA-BBBBBBB. The area code 14 has no trunk prefix and is used for government numbers, currently only for municipalities. The remaining digits represent the area code of the municipality. Therefore, the length 14 numbers total either 5 or 6 digits: 14 0AA or 14 0AAA The trunk prefix '0' is dropped when prefixed by the country code: +31 AA BBBBBBBB, +31 6 CBBBBBBB, etcetera. Note that there is not a trunk prefix for the 14 series so the international number becomes +31 14 0AAA. Norwegian telephone numbers have eight digits. A number to a fixed line is written in four groups of two separated by spaces, AA AA AA AA. Phone numbers in the 8xx series are written in three groups, AAA AA AAA. This makes it easy to determine if the B-number is SMS capable. Mobile numbers start with 4 or 9. Telephone numbers in Poland have nine digits. For mobile phones, the preferred format is AAA-AAA-AAA. For landline phones, the preferred format is AA-BBB-BB-BB, where AA is area code. Occasionally, you can encounter numbers formatted as (AA) BBB-BB-BB. Omitting area code is not permitted, because nowadays it is always required. Telephone numbers in Portugal have nine digits. A number to a fixed line is written in three groups of two separated by spaces, AAA AAA AAA. Cellphone numbers are written in three groups, AAA AAA AAA. Mobile numbers start with 9. Starting with 2002 phone numbers in Romania have ten digits, the first digit always being 0. The preferred format is AAAA-AAA-AAA for mobile, except for landline phones in Bucharest where the preferred format is AAA-AAA-AA-AA. Russia has an open numbering plan with 10-digit phone numbers. Trunk prefix is 8 (or 8~CC when using alternative operators, where CC is 21–23, 52–55). International call prefix is 8~10 (or 8~CC when using alternative operators, where CC is 26–29, 56–59). The country code is 7. Length of geographical area codes (A) is usually 3 to 5 digits; length of non-geographical area codes is 3. The groups of digits in the local subscriber's number (B) are separated by dashes ('-'): BBB-BB-BB, BB-BB-BB, B-BB-BB. The area code is included in parentheses, similarly to E.123 local notation: (AAA) BBB-BB-BB, (AAAA) BB-BB-BB, (AAAAA) B-BB-BB. Area code dialing is optional in most geographical area codes, except Moscow (area codes 495, 498, 499); it is mandatory for non-geographical area codes. E.123 international and Microsoft formats are used for writing local phone numbers as well; international prefix and country code 7 are replaced with trunk code 8 (or 8~CC) when dialing a mandatory area code. Even though trunk code is not needed for calls within the same geographical area, recent convention adds the default trunk code to the phone number notation: 8 (AAAA) BB-BB-BB. For mandatory area code dealing plans, notation 8 AAAA BB-BB-BB is used. These formats are a mix of Microsoft format and E.123 local notation. Mobile phones require full 10-digit number which starts with 3-digit non-geographical area codes 900–990. For international calls abroad or international roaming calls to Russia, E.123 international notation with an international call prefix '+' is the only allowed calling number format. For local calls both 8 and 7 are accepted as a trunk code. Old BBB-BB-BB Old with area code (AAA) BBB-BB-BB Conventional 8 (AAA) BBB-BB-BB Microsoft +7 (AAA) BBB-BB-BB Conventional (mandatory area code) 8 AAA BBB-BB-BB E.123 international +7 AAA BBB BB BB Spanish telephone numbers have nine digits, starting with '9' or '8' for fixed lines (excluding '90x' and '80x') or with '6' or '7' for mobile phones. The first group in fixed lines always identifies the dialed province. That group might be of 2 or 3 digits; for example, 91 and 81 are for Madrid while 925 and 825 are for Toledo. The second group is always of 3 digits as it formerly identified the telephone exchange (it now identifies the telephone area). When the first group has two digits (as in Madrid), the number is usually written in four groups of 2-3-2-2 digits (AB CCC DD DD) When the first group has three digits (as in Toledo), the number is usually written in 3 groups of 3 digits (ABB CCC DDD) but the form 3-2-2-2 (ABB CC CD DD) is not uncommon. Mobile numbers are usually grouped by threes, ABB CCC CCC, but the form 3-2-2-2 is also seen. Swedish telephone numbers have between eight and ten digits. They start with a two to four digit area code. A three digit code starting with 07 indicates that the number is for a mobile phone. All national numbers start with one leading 0, and international destinations are specified by the prefix 00 or +. The numbers are written with the area code followed by a hyphen, and then two to three groups of digits separated by spaces.[8] National 10 digit 0A-XXX XXX XX 0AA-XXX XX XX 0AAA-XX XX XX 0A-XXX XXX XX 0AA-XXX XX XX 0AAA-XX XX XX National 9 digit 0A-XXX XX XX 0AA-XX XX XX 0AAA-XXX XX 0A-XXX XX XX 0AA-XX XX XX 0AAA-XXX XX National 8 digit 0A-XX XX XX 0AA-XXX XX 0A-XX XX XX 0AA-XXX XX Mobile 10 digit 07A-XXX XX XX 07AA-XX XX XX 07A-XXX XX XX 07AA-XX XX XX International +CC AAA-XXX XX XX 00CC AAA-XXX XX XX +CC AAA-XXX XX XX 00CC AAA-XXX XX XX Swiss telephone numbers have ten digits, and usually written 0AA BBB BB BB where 0AA is the national destination code and BBB BB BB is the subscriber number. The entire number must always be dialed, including the leading 0, even if calling within a local area, therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number. According to international convention, numbers are sometimes written +41 AA BBB BB BB to include the country calling code. Certain nationwide destination codes, such as for toll-free or premium-rate telephone numbers, are written 0800 BBB BBB or 0900 BBB BBB. Short numbers are used for emergency services such as 112 that are written 1CC or 1CCC. In Turkey the format for telephone numbers is commonly seen as 0BBB AAA AA AA. While landline numbers having the prefix 02BB AAA AA AA, 03BB AAA AA AA, or 04BB AAA AA AA[9] mobile numbers have the prefix 05BB AAA AA AA. Landline area codes are separated by cities and only one city, Istanbul, has two area codes: 216 for the Asian side, and 212 for the European side. Mobile numbers however are separated by carriers. There are three mobile carriers in Turkey: Vodafone TR, Turkcell and Turk Telekom. Turkcell has the prefix 053B AAA AA AA, Vodafone TR has the prefix 054B AAA AA AA, and Turk Telekom has the prefix 055B AAA AA AA. Since 9 November 2008, with the passing of the Number Carriability Regulation by ICTA, mobile numbers can be carried from one mobile carrier to the other, without having to change the prefix.[10] This caused dialing 05BB to call another number on the same carrier to become mandatory. Calls to numbers which were carried to another operator are signaled by a unique sound upon dialing, to signify that the recipient is on another network and alert them against potentially unwanted interconnection charges. The same regulation passed on 10 September 2009 regarding landline numbers, without the requirement to dial the prefix among numbers with the same geographical area, sharing the same prefix. The \"0\" on every prefix is an Area Code Exit code that must be dialed when a number with a different area code is being called. So when calling from outside of Turkey those 0s are not dialed. The dialing format when calling from outside Turkey is +90 BBB AAA AA AA and NOT +90 0BBB AAA AA AA. Unlike the North American system, the Country Exit Code isn't 011 but 00. So it is one \"0\" to exit area and one more \"0\" to exit the country. There are many recommendations for recording phone numbers. The most common in the world is Recommendation E.123 E.123 International Telecommunication Union[11] and the standard format for Microsoft telephone numbers Microsoft.[12] There is an international format for recording a telephone number containing the country code, settlement code and telephone number, and the national format containing the settlement code and telephone number. To record Ukrainian telephone numbers, telephone codes for settlements do not have an initial zero, long-distance prefix: 0. +380 44 123 45 67 E.123, international format: country code, settlement code and telephone number are separated by spaces (044) 123 45 67 E.123, national format: long-distance prefix and city code in parentheses (national format: long-distance prefix and settlement code in parentheses due to possible confusion needs constant additional clarification), п. 2.8 [11] ), the phone number is separated from the code and separated by spaces +380 (44) 1234567 Microsoft, international format: country code, space code, settlement code in brackets, space code, telephone number. Dialling codes, also known as \"area codes\" are optional for local callers (often surrounded by parentheses, or separated with a dash), though there are trials running to make them mandatory,[13] and are followed by the customer's telephone number. Codes with the form 02x are followed by 8-digit local numbers and are usually written as 02x AAAA AAAA or (02x) AAAA AAAA. Area codes with the form 011x or 01x1 are used for many of the major population centres in the UK, are always followed by 7-digit local numbers and are usually written as 01xx AAA BBBB, (01xx) AAA BBBB or 01x1-AAA BBBB (the latter formerly the recommended format for six major metropolitan areas in the UK). Other area codes have the form 01xxx with 5 or 6 figure local numbers written as 01xxx or (01xxx) followed by subscriber number AAAAA or AAAAAA; or have the form 01xx xx with 4 or 5 figure local numbers written as 01xx xx or (01xx xx) followed by subscriber number AAAA or AAAAA. Numbers for mobile phones and pagers are formatted as 07AAA BBBBBB and most other non-geographic numbers are 10 figures in length (excluding trunk digit '0') and formatted as 0AAA BBB BBBB. However, these numbers are sometimes written in other formats. 9 figure freephone numbers are 0500 AAAAAA and 0800 AAAAAA and there is one number of 8 figures length: 0800 1111 (Childline). Domestically, there are also a number of special service numbers such as 100 for the operator, 123 for the speaking clock and 155 for the international operator, as well as 118 AAA for various directory enquiry services, and 116 AAA for various helplines. For some services, the number you call will depend on which operator you use to connect the call. 112 and 999 work for calling the emergency services. These numbers cannot be called from abroad. When calling from abroad, the initial '0' trunk prefix is not required; it is, however, commonplace to represent telephone numbers with both the international code and the '0' trunk prefix - which is typically placed within parentheses - but this representation is inconsistent with the E.123 international standard.[14] Twenty-four countries and territories share the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), with a single country code, 1. The formatting convention for telephone numbers is (NPA) NXX-XXXX, where NPA is the three-digit area code, and NXX-XXXX is the seven-digit subscriber number.[15] NPA has the same syntax of NXX since the implementation of interchangeable area codes in 1995. The prefix NXX of the subscriber number is the central office code, unique in the numbering plan area. The place holder N stands for the digits 2 to 9, as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1. It is a closed telephone numbering plan in which all subscriber telephone numbers have seven digits, in addition to the three-digit area code. Under all-number calling, a numbering plan introduced around 1960, local calls within an area code were placed by dialing NXX-XXXX, omitting the area code, known as seven-digit dialing. Only calling a destination in a different area code required dialing the destination area code, known as ten-digit dialing. Due to the need for a larger telephone number pool in many regions, seven-digit dialing is becoming rare in the United States. With the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century, many metropolitan areas saw the introduction of additional area codes. Multiple area codes were assigned to the same numbering plan area, a configuration known as an overlay numbering plan. Calls within an overlay are still local calls, despite the need for ten-digit dialing. In general, placing long-distance calls requires dialing the trunk code 1, but this may be optional in some areas. Canada is a member of the North American Numbering Plan, but administers its numbering resources individually, under guidance from the NANP Administrator. The Canadian government has stated on its Language Portal of Canada that telephone numbers are to be written with a hyphen between each sequence, as follows: 1-NPA-NXX-XXXX or NPA-NXX-XXXX.[16] 10-digit dialing is now required throughout most of Canada, including all of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, as well as most of Ontario. Areas not yet requiring 10-digit dialing are Ontario's 807 area code, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, although 10-digit dialing may be accepted in some of these areas. In the province of Québec, where French is the first language, the Office québécois de la langue française has established that telephone numbers must be written with spaces first and then a hyphen for the last sequence, as follows: 1 NPA NXX-XXXX.[17] Mexican telephone numbers have ten digits. They can consist of a two-digit (NN) area code and an eight-digit local number (ABCD XXXX) or a three-digit area code (NNN) with a seven-digit local number (ABC XXXX). As of August 3, 2019 all the indicators and access codes (01, 044, 045) are deprecated, therefore all telephone numbers, for landline or mobile service, are dialed with ten digits.[18] The formatting convention of a telephone number is ABCD XXXX or NN ABCD XXXX or (NN) ABCD-XXXX ABC XX XX or NNN ABC XXXX or (NNN) ABC-XX-XX The international country code prefix for Mexico is 52. When dialing a number it must be formatted as \"plus sign + country code + 10-digit number\" e.g.: +52 NNN ABC XXXX Some Central American countries write the country code for their own and other Central American countries in parentheses, instead of using a + sign, as recommended by E.123. For example, for a number in Costa Rica they would write (506) 2222-2222 instead of +506 2222-2222. On the other hand, Guatemala does have the custom of using the + sign. It is quite common for Central American businesses to write the whole phone number, including the country code in parentheses, on business cards, signs, stationery, etc. Costa Rican telephone numbers have eight digits, and are usually written in the format 2NNN-NNNN (for landlines), 8NNN-NNNN (for mobile telephone numbers from local telephone company ICE), 6NNN-NNNN (for mobile telephone numbers from Movistar) and 7NNN-NNNN (for mobile phone numbers from Claro).[19] Toll-free numbers use the format 800-NNN-NNNN and premium-rate telephone numbers are written 90x-NNN-NNNN where x varies according to the type of service offered. There are also \"short numbers\" for emergencies such as 911. When Costa Rica switched from 7- to 8-digit numbers, it used a scheme similar to the 8-digit number scheme already in place in El Salvador at that time. El Salvadoran telephone numbers have eight digits, usually written in the format 2NNN-NNNN (for landline use) and 7NNN-NNNN (for mobile telephone numbers). Premium-rate numbers start with a 9. Guatemalan telephone numbers have eight digits and written in the format 2NNN-NNNN for landlines in Guatemala City, 6NNN-NNNN for landlines for the rest of municipalities in the Guatemala Department, and 7NNN-NNNN for landlines in Rural Guatemala / rest of country. Non-geographic numbers (mobile) are 5NNN-NNNN, 4NNN-NNNN, and 3NNN-NNNN. Within each area, there are different service providers. The following 3 digits indicate the service provider. However, their assignment is on a first-come first-served basis. Additionally there are special numbers with the following conventions: 3 digit numbers for emergency systems, four digit numbers, 15NN for information and governmental institutions and 17NN for commercial and banking institutions with a high call influx, 6 digit numbers for Telephone carriers numbers and making operator assisted calls, collect calls. These calls are billed at different rates. 1-800: Toll-free calls redirected to out of country offices and 1-801: Local toll-free calls.[20] Honduran telephone numbers have either seven digits (for landlines), which are usually written NNN-NNNN, or eight digits (for mobile numbers), which are written NNNN-NNNN. The fact that landline and mobile numbers are different lengths sometimes causes confusion. In 2010, an additional digit (2) was added to the start of land line numbers, thus standardizing the length at eight digits. Argentine telephone numbers always consist of 11 digits, including the geographical area code. The area code can have 3, 4 or 5 digits, the first being always 0 (indicative of long-distance calls). Moreover, in 1999 the whole country (except Buenos Aires, and Greater Buenos Aires) was divided into two zones. Roughly and with exceptions, one includes most of the northern half of the country; and the other, most of the southern half, though the actual reason for this division is not geographical, but the fact that each zone is administered by a different company. So, the second digit of area codes can be 1 (only in Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires code \"011\") or else a 2 (for towns in the southern half of the country) or a 3 (for the northern half). For example, (011) for Buenos Aires, (0341) for Rosario, (02627) for San Rafael. And the subscriber's number will accordingly have 6, 7 or 8 digits, to complete the eleven digits. Phone numbers are mostly written as: (011) xxxx-xxxx (Note that only the (011) code has 3 digits), (0xxx) xxx-xxxx or (0xxxx) xx-xxxx The area code is usually written between brackets. In 1999, a general reform was introduced to telephone numbers, including the 1, 2 and 3 for area codes as explained above, and adding a 4 at the beginning of all subscriber's numbers. However, since the reform some local numbers starting with a 5 are beginning to appear. Moreover, a hyphen is usually placed to separate the last four digits. Code areas do not usually include one single city or town, but several neighbouring towns. So, the part before the hyphen (called a prefix) is usually indicative of either a town within the code area, or even of a part of a larger city, which is assigned several prefixes. As a matter of fact, each area code has only a limited number of prefixes assigned, and these are locally limited within the area. For example, the (0342) area has numbers with a 456- prefix, mostly located in the centre of Santa Fe. It also has numbers with a 460- prefix, usually for phone lines in the north east of the city. And there are lines with a 474- prefix, located in Santo Tomé. But no 444- prefix exists within this area. As for the part after the hyphen, it may usually be any succession of four digits, though sometimes a prefix is shared by two or more small towns, and then, the first digit after the hyphen carries the distinction between towns. Sometimes, a prefix is reserved for official numbers, that is for offices depending on the national, provincial or local state. In the (0342) area, this is 457-, and phones within this prefix communicate with each other, by simply dialing the four final digits, though from other phones the prefix must be dialled as well. Mobile phones use the same area codes as landline telephones, but the number begins with a \"15\", added to a string of 6, 7 or 8 digits, just as described above. After the \"15\", the remainder of the number can start with a 3, a 4, a 5 or a 6. This \"15\" may be dropped when a call is made to a mobile phone in a different code area. And when sending text messages, the receiver's number is best dialled both without the \"15\" and with the long-distance code, even if both sender and receiver share a code area, but without the initial \"0\". To sum up, given the mobile phone (011) 154-123-4567, you will call it by dialing: 154-123-4567 (within the same code area), (011) [15]4-123-4567 (from a different code area, including or omitting the 15), And you will send messages to: 11 4-123-4567 (even when your phone has also a 011 number). Two sorts of special numbers exist in Argentina. On the one hand, three-digit numbers are used for special services such as to call the police, fire brigade or emergency doctors, as well as to hear the official time. Also telephone companies have three-digit numbers to report a problem in the lines, or to ask for another subscriber's number, when a paper directory is not available. Additionally, there are other longer numbers. These include (but are not limited to): 0800 xxx abcd 0810 xxx abcd 0600 xxx abcd (where the xxx indicates the same digit dialled three times, and a, b, c and d may each be any of the ten digits) 0800 lines are used by companies, and it is the receiver and not the caller who pays for the call, so that potential clients are encouraged to contact business companies for free. 0810 lines are paid by the caller, but the cost is for a local call, even if you are calling from a different area. The remaining is covered by the receiver. And 0600 numbers are special more expensive lines, that serve such purposes as TV games, fund collecting for charity companies, hot lines, etc. Basically a part of the extra money charged to the caller is sent to the owner of the line. Often the abcd or even (xx)xabcd part of the number is chosen, if available, to form a word that is representative of the company holding the number. Brazil is divided into 67 two-digit geographical area codes, all of which with eight-digit numbers, in the format AA NNNN-NNNN, except for cell phones, which contain nine digits, usually in the format AA 9NNNN-NNNN. Peru uses 2-digit area codes followed by 6-digit subscriber numbers outside of Lima. In Lima the area code is \"1\" and the subscriber number has seven digits, divided XXX XXXX. The \"trunk 0\" is often used, especially for numbers outside Lima. For example, a phone number in Arequipa might be written (054) XX-XXXX. Cellphone numbers used to have eight digits with the first digit always being 9. In 2008 an additional digit was added to cellphone numbers, while land numbers remained the same. The previous convention for cell numbers in Lima was usually 9XXX XXXX, though 9-XXX XXXX was also used. With the new 9-digit number, the form 9XX XXX XXX is becoming increasingly common as opposed to 9 XXXX XXXX, 9X XXX XXXX or 9XXXX XXXX. Outside Lima cellphone numbers used to be 9 followed by six digits, i.e., 9 XXX XXX. The 2008 changes were somewhat more complicated. In four departments (similar to states), a 2 digit code now has to be entered before the 9. In the example of Arequipa, the code of 95 has to be entered before the 9, so the new numeration is 959 XXX XXX. The other codes are 94 for La Libertad (Trujillo), 96 for Piura and 97 for Lambayeque (Chiclayo). In the other 19 rural departments, the 9 is followed by the department's 2-digit area code then the 6-digit subscriber number. For example, the area code for Cusco is 84, so their new cellphone numeration is 984 XXX XXX. The effect is that all Peruvian cellphone numbers now have nine digits; under the old system they had eight digits in Lima and 7 everywhere else.[21] Long distance calling Short code ^ \"Karachi and Lahore now have eight digit phone numbers.

Natural language processing   news   news   books   scholar   JSTOR  May 2024 Learn how and when to remove this message Natural language processing NLP is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics Typically data is collected in text corpora using either rulebased statistical or neuralbased approaches in machine learning and deep learning Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s1 Already in 1950 Alan Turing published an article titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language The premise of symbolic NLP is wellsummarized by John Searles Chinese room experiment Given a collection of rules eg a Chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other NLP tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English The authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem2 However real progress was much slower and after the ALPAC report in 1966 which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America though some research continued elsewhere such as Japan and Europe3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and ELIZA a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 Using almost no information about human thought or emotion ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly humanlike interaction When the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base ELIZA might provide a generic response for example responding to My head hurts with Why do you say your head hurts Ross Quillians successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time4 1970s During the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured realworld information into computerunderstandable data Examples are MARGIE Schank 1975 SAM Cullingford 1978 PAM Wilensky 1978 TaleSpin Meehan 1976 QUALM Lehnert 1977 Politics Carbonell 1979 and Plot Units Lehnert 1981 During this time the first chatterbots were written eg PARRY 1980s The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP Focus areas of the time included research on rulebased parsing eg the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology eg twolevel morphology5 semantics eg Lesk algorithm reference eg within Centering Theory6 and other areas of natural language understanding eg in the Rhetorical Structure Theory Other lines of research were continued eg the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky An important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period7 Up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules Starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing This was due to both the steady increase in computational power see Moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing8 1990s Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at IBM Research such as IBM alignment models These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government However most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems As a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s With the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data have become available since the mid1990s Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semisupervised learning algorithms Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been handannotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and nonannotated data Generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data However there is an enormous amount of nonannotated data available including among other things the entire content of the World Wide Web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical In 2003 word ngram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was outperformed by a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling by Yoshua Bengio with coauthors9 In 2010 Tom Mikolov then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology with coauthors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling10 and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec In the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques1112 can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling13 and parsing1415 This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care16 or protect patient privacy17 Symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular1819 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming Machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rulebased approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar eg containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input eg with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rulebased systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rulebased systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems Although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023 Before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods eg for the machine translation of lowresource languages such as provided by the Apertium system for preprocessing in NLP pipelines eg tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines eg for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses In the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches2021 The earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches Only the introduction of hidden Markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering Since 201522 the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks23 and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words Intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore Neural machine translation based on thennewlyinvented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing Some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks Though natural language processing tasks are

representation learning and endtoend systems Most higherlevel NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language More broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses47 Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes48 Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics49 Especially during the age of symbolic NLP the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies As an example George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing NLP algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics50 with two defining aspects Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by Lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author51 For example consider the English word big When used in a comparison That is a big tree the authors intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience When used metaphorically Tomorrow is a big day the authors intent to imply importance The intent behind other usages like in She is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information Assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed eg by means of a probabilistic contextfree grammar PCFG The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US Patent 9269353  Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s Nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar53 functional grammar54 construction grammar55 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg ACTR however with limited uptake in mainstream NLP as measured by presence on major conferences56 of the ACL More recently ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability eg under the notion of cognitive AI57 Likewise ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP although rarely made explicit58 and developments in artificial intelligence specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches59 and new directions in artificial

cases that stress the limits of its theoretical models comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics typically created using thought experiments rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in realworld data as is the case in corpus linguistics The creation and use of such corpora of realworld data is a fundamental part of machinelearning algorithms for natural language processing In addition theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the socalled poverty of the stimulus argument entail that general learning algorithms as are typically used in machine learning cannot be successful in language processing As a result the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing  Bengio Yoshua

computational approaches to linguistic questions In general computational linguistics draws upon linguistics computer science artificial intelligence mathematics logic philosophy cognitive science cognitive psychology psycholinguistics anthropology and neuroscience among others The field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages particularly Russian scientific journals into English1 Since rulebased approaches were able to make arithmetic systematic calculations much faster and more accurately than humans it was expected that lexicon morphology syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules as well After the failure of rulebased approaches David Hays2 coined the term in order to distinguish the field from AI and cofounded both the Association for Computational Linguistics ACL and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics ICCL in the 1970s and 1980s What started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing34 In order to be able to meticulously study the English language an annotated text corpus was much needed The Penn Treebank5 was one of the most used corpora It consisted of IBM computer manuals transcribed telephone conversations and other texts together containing over 45 million words of American English annotated using both partofspeech tagging and syntactic bracketing6 Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of lognormality was found in relation to sentence length7 The fact that during language acquisition children are largely only exposed to positive evidence8 meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided and no evidence for what is not correct9 was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s10 It has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span11 which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children11 Robots have been used to test linguistic theories12 Enabled to learn as children might models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions perceptions and effects were created and linked to spoken words Crucially these robots were able to acquire functioning wordtomeaning mappings without needing grammatical structure Using the Price equation and Plya urn dynamics researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modernday languages13 Chomskys theories have influenced computational linguistics particularly in understanding how infants learn complex grammatical structures such as those described in Chomsky normal form14 Attempts have been made to determine how an infant learns a nonnormal grammar as theorized by Chomsky normal form9 Research in this area combines structural approaches with computational models to analyze large linguistic corpora like the Penn Treebank helping to uncover patterns in language acquisition15 Philosophy portal Artificial intelligence in fiction Collostructional analysis Computational

study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions1 Quick progress in the field of deep learning beginning in 2010s allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance2 ML finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine34 The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics Statistics and mathematical optimization mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning Data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis EDA via unsupervised learning67 From a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct PAC learning provides a framework for describing machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence89 The synonym selfteaching computers was also used in this time period1011 Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes12 In 1949 Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells13 Hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data12 Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes12 By the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called Cybertron had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning It was repetitively trained by a human operatorteacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions14 A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilssons book on Learning Machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification15 Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by Duda and Hart in 197316 In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal17 Tom M Mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T as measured by P improves with experience E18 This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms This follows Alan Turings proposal in his paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which the question Can machines think is replaced with the question Can machines do what we as thinking entities can do19 Modernday machine learning has two objectives One is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions20 As a scientific endeavor machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence AI In the early days of AI as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics22 Probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis23 488 However an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation23 488 By 1980 expert systems had come to dominate AI and statistics was out of favor24 Work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within AI leading to inductive logic programmingILP but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval23 708710 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time This line too was continued outside the AICS field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield Rumelhart and Hinton Their main success came in the mid1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation23 25 Machine learning ML reorganized and recognized as its own field started to flourish in the 1990s The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory24 There is a close connection between machine learning and compression A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution Conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence252627 An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors and compressionbased similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces For each compressor C we define an associated vector space  such that C maps an input string x corresponding to the vector norm x An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space instead feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods LZW LZ77 and PPM28 According to AIXI theory a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x For example in that model a zip files compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software since you can not unzip it without both but there may be an even smaller combined form Examples of AIpowered audiovideo compression software include NVIDIA Maxine AIVC29 Examples of software that can perform AIpowered image compression include OpenCV TensorFlow MATLABs Image Processing Toolbox IPT and HighFidelity Generative Image Compression30 In unsupervised machine learning kmeans clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression31 Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission Kmeans clustering an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters k each represented by the centroid of its points This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing kmeans clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space32 Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases Data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy Much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ECML PKDD being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining KDD the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge Evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical KDD task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples34 Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns35 According to Michael I Jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics36 He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field36 Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set In addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis In contrast machine learning is not built on a prestructured model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns The more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be37 Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model38 wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning39 Analytical and computational techniques derived from deeprooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to largescale problems including machine learning eg to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks40 Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics41 A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience542 Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the Probably Approximately Correct Learning PAC model Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms Instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common The biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error For the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data If the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data If the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases But if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer43 In addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning In computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time There are two kinds of time complexity results Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system Supervised learning The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs Unsupervised learning No labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning Reinforcement learning A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent As it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback thats analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize5 Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems444546 Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs47 The data known as training data consists of a set of training examples Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal In the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix Through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs48 An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task18 Types of supervisedlearning algorithms include active learning classification and regression49 Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range As an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person or the future temperature 50 Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are It has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled classified or categorized Instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction7 and density estimation51 Unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pangenome52 Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity A special type of unsupervised learning called selfsupervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself5455 Semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data Some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy In weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets56 Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward Due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulationbased optimization multiagent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms In reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process MDP Many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques57 Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables58 In other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis PCA PCA involves changing higherdimensional data eg 3D to a smaller space eg 2D The manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this threefold categorization and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system For example topic modeling metalearning59 Selflearning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array CAA60 It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice The CAA selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion61 The selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix W was such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s compute emotion of being in the consequence situation vs update crossbar memory was  was  vs It is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment The backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation The CAA exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment After receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the CAA learns a goalseeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations62 Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training63 Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis Feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised In supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data Examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning In unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data Examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization64 and various forms of clustering656667 Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors68 Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data69 Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process However realworld data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix The method is strongly NPhard and difficult to solve approximately70 A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the kSVD algorithm Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts In classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs For a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot71 In data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data72 Typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text Anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions73 In particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object Many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately Instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the microclusters formed by these patterns74 Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist75 Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection Semisupervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning7677 and finally metalearning eg MAML Association rule learning is a rulebased machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness78 Rulebased machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge The defining characteristic of a rulebased machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction79 Rulebased machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems Based on the concept of strong rules Rakesh Agrawal Tomasz Imieliski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in largescale transaction data recorded by pointofsale POS systems in supermarkets80 For example the rule  o n i o n s  p o t a t o e s    b u r g e r  displaystyle mathrm onionspotatoes Rightarrow mathrm burger  found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements In addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics In contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions Learning classifier systems LCS are a family of rulebased machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning They seek to identify a set of contextdependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions81 Inductive logic programming ILP is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting828384 Shapiro built their first implementation Model Inference System in 1981 a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples85 The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a wellordered set A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that after being trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data During training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the models internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions86 By extension the term model can refer to several levels of specificity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned87 Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection Artificial neural networks ANNs or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains Such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain Each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it In common ANN implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs The connections between artificial neurons are called edges Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold Typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs Signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would However over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition88 Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees In decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making In data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decisionmaking Supportvector machines SVMs also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression Given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category89 An SVM training algorithm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting In addition to performing linear classification SVMs can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features Its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression When dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel90 logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space A Bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph DAG For example a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms Given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic Bayesian networks Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a predefined covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations Given a set of observed points or inputoutput examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization A genetic algorithm GA is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem In machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s9293 Conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms94 The theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or DempsterShafer theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability possibility and imprecise probability theories These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined eg Dempsters rule of combination just like how in a pmfbased Bayesian approachclarification needed would combine probabilities However there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learners decision boundary low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving49 However the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches Typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions When training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model Trained models derived from biased or nonevaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices For example Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google95 There are many applications for machine learning including Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decisionmaking Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brainmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Creditcard fraud

Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Timeseries forecasting Tomographic reconstruction97 User behavior analytics In 2006 the mediaservices provider Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10 A joint team made up of researchers from ATT LabsResearch in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for 1 million98 Shortly after the prize was awarded Netflix realized that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly99 In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis100 In 2012 cofounder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software101 In 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists102 In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning103 In 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID19104 Machine learning was recently applied to predict the proenvironmental behavior of travelers105 Recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphones performance and thermal behavior based on the users interaction with the phone106107108 When applied correctly machine learning algorithms MLAs can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS109 Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes110 Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes111112113 Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires114115 Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machinelearning programs often fail to deliver expected results116117118 Reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems119 The black box theory poses another yet significant challenge Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data120 The House of Lords Select Committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individuals life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes120 In 2018 a selfdriving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision121 Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested122123 Microsofts Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users124 Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature While it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves125 Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data When trained on humanmade data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society126 Language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases127128 In an experiment carried out by ProPublica an investigative journalism organization a machine learning algorithms insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants129 In 2015 Google Photos would often tag black people as gorillas129 and in 2018 this still was not well resolved but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all130 Similar issues with recognizing nonwhite people have been found in many other systems131 In 2016 Microsoft tested Tay a chatbot that learned from Twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language132 Because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains133 Concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including FeiFei Li who reminds engineers that theres nothing artificial about AI Its inspired by people its created by people andmost importantlyit impacts people It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility134 Explainable AI XAI or Interpretable AI or Explainable Machine Learning XML is artificial intelligence AI in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI135 It contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision136 By refining the mental models of users of AIpowered systems and dismantling their misconceptions XAI promises to help users perform more effectively XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation Settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is137 Learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses138 A realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies139140 Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations For some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel141 Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation andor evasion via adversarial machine learning142 Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying eg for categories spam and wellvisible not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed andor trained by third parties Parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided possibly including whitebox access143144145 Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set In comparison the Kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K1 subsets for training the model In addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy146 In addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate TPR and True Negative Rate TNR respectively Similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate FPR as well as the false negative rate FNR However these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators The total operating characteristic TOC is an effective method to express a models diagnostic ability TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic ROC and ROCs associated area under the curve AUC147 Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices148 For example in 1988 the UKs Commission for Racial Equality found that St Georges Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have nonEuropean sounding names126 Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants149150 Another example includes predictive policing company Geoliticas predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of overpolicing in lowincome and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data129 While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learnings vulnerability to biases151 In fact according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association CRA in 2021 female faculty merely make up 161 of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world152 Furthermore among the group of new US resident AI PhD graduates 45 identified as white 224 as Asian 32 as Hispanic and 24 as African American which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI152 AI can be wellequipped to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning153 Because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases154155 Other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines156 This is especially true in the United States where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits For example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated157 Since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units158 By 2019 graphic processing units GPUs often with AIspecific enhancements had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud AI159 OpenAI estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet 2012 to AlphaZero 2017 and found a 300000fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of 34 months160161 A physical neural network or Neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse Physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to softwarebased approaches More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse162163 Embedded Machine Learning is a subfield of machine learning where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers164165166 Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration167168 using approximate computing169 optimization of machine learning models and many more170171 Pruning Quantization Knowledge Distillation LowRank Factorization Network

amongst virtual communities and networks12 Common features include2 Online platforms that enable users to create and share content and participate in social networking234 Usergenerated contentsuch as text posts or comments digital photos or videos and data generated through online interactions23 Servicespecific profiles that are designed and maintained by the social media organization25 Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a users profile with those of other individuals or groups25 The term social in regard to media suggests platforms enable communal activity Social media can enhance and extend human networks6 Users access social media through webbased apps or custom apps on mobile devices These interactive platforms allow individuals communities and organizations to share cocreate discuss participate in and modify usergenerated or selfcurated content751 Social media is used to document memories learn and form friendships8 They may be used to promote people companies products and ideas8 Social media can be used to consume publish or share news Popular social media platforms with over 100 million registered users include Twitter Facebook WeChat ShareChat Instagram Pinterest QZone Weibo VK Tumblr Baidu Tieba Threads and LinkedIn Depending on interpretation other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services include YouTube Letterboxd QQ Quora Telegram WhatsApp Signal LINE Snapchat Pinterest Viber Reddit Discord and TikTok Wikis are examples of collaborative content creationaccording to whom Social media outlets differ from old media eg newspapers TV and radio broadcasting in many ways including quality9 reach frequency usability relevancy and permanence10 Social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system many sources to many receivers while traditional media operate under a monologic  transmission model one source to many receivers For instance a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city11 Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers including exposure to inappropriate content exploitation by adults sleep problems attention problems feelings of exclusion and various mental health maladies1213 Social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy The PLATO system was launched in 1960 at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes PLATOs messageforum application TERMtalk its instantmessaging feature Talkomatic perhaps the first online chat room News Report a crowdsourced online newspaper and blog and Access Lists enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users for example only friends classmates or coworkers ARPANET which came online in 1967 had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of nongovernmentbusiness ideas and communication as evidenced by the network etiquette or netiquette described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MITs Artificial Intelligence Laboratory14 ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1990s15 Usenet conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University was the first open social media app established in 1980 A precursor of the electronic bulletin board system BBS known as Community Memory appeared by 1973 Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago which launched on February 16 1978 Before long most major US cities had more than one BBS running on TRS80 Apple II Atari 8bit computers IBM PC Commodore 64 Sinclair and others CompuServe Prodigy and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s Between the mid1980s and the mid1990s BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone16 Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s In 1991 Tim BernersLee integrated HTML hypertext software with the Internet creating the World Wide Web This breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs list servers and email services Message forums migrated to the web and evolved into Internet forums supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously These early textbased systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century aided by digital cameras and camera phones17 The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web 206 Social media started in the mid1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities Classmatescom and SixDegreescom18 While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously It boasted features like profiles friends lists and school affiliations making it the very first social networking site1819 The platforms name was inspired by the six degrees of separation concept which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else20 In the early 2000s social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace followed by Facebook YouTube and Twitter21 Research from 2015 reported that globally users spent 22 of their online time on social networks22 likely fueled by the availability of smartphones23 As of 2023 as many as 476 billion people used social media24 some 59 of the global population A 2015 review identified four features unique to social media services2 Web 20 Internetbased applications23 Usergenerated content23 Usercreated self profiles25 Social networks formed by connections between profiles25 such as followers groups and lists In 2019 MerriamWebster defined social media as forms of electronic communication such as websites for social networking and microblogging through which users create online communities to share information ideas personal messages and other content such as videos25 Social media

than one type of service5 Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets It is distinguished by its ubiquity since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer Mobile services can further make use of the users immediate location to offer information connections or services relevant to that location According to Andreas Kaplan mobile social media activities fall among four types27 Spacetimers location and timesensitive Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time posting about a traffic jam Spacelocators only location sensitive Postsmessages with relevance for a specific location read later by others eg a restaurant review Quicktimers only time sensitive Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy eg posting status updates Slowtimers neither location nor time sensitive Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices eg watching a video Certain content has the potential to spread virally an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual One user spreads a post across their network which leads those users to follow suit A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours Virality is not guaranteed few posts make the transition Viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns Nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content such as Xs and Facebooks like option28 Bots are automated programs that operate on the internet29 They automate many communication tasks This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers30 Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking commenting and following31 Bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing32 Bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions33 Some bots violate platforms terms of use which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically34 Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions35 Cyborgseither botassisted humans or humanassisted bots35are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz363738 A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time39 A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time In other cases cyborgs spread fake news35 Cyborgs may work as sock puppets where one human pretends to be someone else or operates multiple accounts each pretending to be a person A multitude of United States patents are related to social media growing rapidlycitation needed As of 2020update  over 5000 social media patent applications had been published in the United States40 Only slightly over 100 patents had been

as a place people were getting health information During the COVID19 pandemic social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems68 This also led to the spread of disinformation On December 11 2020 the CDC put out a Call to Action Managing the Infodemic69 Some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on their Twitter data70 Promotion of the joint usage of PedsICU and COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care70 However others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction as it became an increasingly important context and therefore source of social validation and reinforcement and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful71 Governments may use social media to for example72 inform their opinions to public interact with citizens foster citizen participation further open government analyzemonitor public opinion and activities educate the public about risks and public health73 Social media has been used extensively in civil and criminal investigations74 It has also been used to search for missing persons75 Police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public publicize police activity

known as CPB and the United States Department of Homeland Security use social media data as influencing factors during the visa process and monitor individuals after they have entered the country79 CPB officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border searching both citizens and noncitizens without first obtaining a warrant79 As social media gained momentum among the younger generations governments began using it to improve their image especially among the youth In January 2021 Egyptian authorities were reported to be using Instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program The program was designed to revamp Egypts image and to counter the bad press Egypt had received because of the countrys human rights record Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in similar programs80 Similarly Dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism However Dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities or to criticize the city politics or religion The content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays Dubai in a negative light81 Many businesses use social media for marketing branding82 advertising communication sales promotions informal employeelearningorganizational development competitive analysis recruiting relationship managementloyalty programs27 and eCommerce Companies use socialmedia monitoring tools to monitor track and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing sales and other programs Tools range from free basic applications to subscriptionbased tools Social media offers information on industry trends Within the finance industry companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment These range from marketing financial products market trends and as a tool to identify insider trading83 To exploit these opportunities businesses need guidelines for use on each platform3 Business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence Instead it makes its case by participating in the conversation84 Business uses social media85 on a customerorganizational level and an intraorganizational level Social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by highlighting successes and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily availableknown86 Social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections

when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it Owned social media is the platform markets itself by creatingpromoting content to its users88 Primary uses are to create brand awareness engage customers by conversation eg customers provide feedback on the firm and providing access to customer service89 Social medias peertopeer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company90 Social media personalities often referred to as influencers are Internet celebrities who are sponsored by marketers to promote products and companies online Research reports that these endorsements attract the attention of users who have not settled on which productsservices to buy91 especially younger consumers92 The practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to as influencer marketing In 2013 the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority ASA began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag spon or ad when endorsing The US Federal Trade Commission issued similar guidelines93 Social media platforms also enable targeting specific audiences with advertising Users of social media can share and comment on the advertisement turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers94 Targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users3 Companies can use humor such as shitposting to poke fun at competitors95 Advertising can even inspire fanart which can engage new audiences96 Hashtags such as ejuice and eliquid are one way to target interested users97 User content can trigger peer effects increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement A 2012 study focused on this communication reported that communication among

political messages103 Foreignoriginated socialmedia campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country104105 Social media was influential in the Arab Spring in 2011106107108109 However debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this110 Activists have used social media to report the abuse of human rights in Bahrain They publicized the brutality of government authorities who they claimed were detaining torturing and threatening individuals Conversely Bahrains government used social media to track and target activists The government stripped citizenship from over 1000 activists as punishment111 Militant groups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool112 Islamic State also known as ISIS used social media In 2014 AllEyesonISIS went viral on Arabic X113114 Social media use in hiring refers to the examination by employers of job applicants public social media profiles as part of the hiring assessment For example the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees and as a tool for talent acquisition115 This practice raises ethical questions Employers and recruiters note that they have access only to information that applicants choose to make public Many WesternEuropean countries restrict employers use of social media in the workplace States including Arkansas California Colorado Illinois Maryland Michigan Nevada New Jersey New Mexico Utah Washington and Wisconsin protect applicants and employees from surrendering usernames and passwords for social media accountscitation needed Use of social media as caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media A 2013 survey of 17000 young people in six countries found that one in ten people aged 16 to 34 claimed to have been rejected for a job because of social media activity116117 Scientists use social media to share their scientific knowledge and research on platforms such as ResearchGate LinkedIn Facebook X and Academiaedu118 The most common platforms are X and blogs The use of social media reportedly has improved the interaction between scientists reporters and the general publiccitation needed Over 495000 opinions were shared on X related to science between September 1 2010 and August 31 2011119 Science related blogs respond to and motivate public interest in learning following and discussing science Posts can be written quickly and allow the reader to interact in real time with authors120 One study in the context of climate change reported that climate scientists and scientific institutions played a minimal role in online debate exceeded by nongovernmental organizations121 Academicians use social media activity to assess academic publications122 to measure public sentiment123 identify influencer accounts124 or crowdsource ideas or solutions125 Social media such as Facebook X are also combined to predict elections via sentiment analysis126 Additional social media eg YouTube Google Trends can be combined to reach a wider segment of the voting population minimise mediaspecific bias and inexpensively estimate electoral predictions which are on average half of a percentage point off the real vote share127 In some places students have been forced to surrender their social media passwords to school administrators128 Few laws protect students social media privacy Organizations such as the ACLU call for more privacy protection They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to resist129 Colleges and universities may access applicants internet services including social media profiles as part of their admissions process According to Kaplan Inc a corporation that provides higher education preparation in 2012 27 of admissions officers used Google to learn more about an applicant with 26 checking Facebook130 Students whose social media pages include questionable material may be disqualified from admission processes One survey in July 2017 by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers reported that 11 percent of respondents said they had refused to admit an applicant based on social media content This includes 8 percent of public institutions where the First Amendment applies The survey reported that 30 percent of institutions acknowledged reviewing the personal social media accounts of applicants at least some of the time131 Social media comments and images have been used in court cases including employment law child custodychild support and disability claims After an Apple employee criticized his employer on Facebook he was fired When the former employee sued Apple for unfair dismissal the court after examining the employees Facebook posts reported in favor of Apple stating that the posts breached Apples policies132 After a couple broke up the man posted song lyrics that talked about fantasies of killing the rappers exwife and made threats A court reported him guilty132clarification needed In a disability claims case a woman who fell at work claimed that she was permanently injured the employer used her social media posts to counter her claims132 Courts do not always admit social media evidence in part because screenshots can be faked or tampered with133 Judges may consider emojis into account to assess statements made on social media in one Michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment the judge disagreed noting that an emoji after the comment that indicated that it was a joke133 In a 2014 case in Ontario against a police officer regarding alleged assault of a protester during the G20 summit the court rejected the Crowns application to use a digital photo of the protest that was anonymously posted online because it included no metadata verifying its provenance133 Social media as a news source is the use of online social media platforms rather than moreover traditional media platforms to obtain news Just as television turned a nation of people who listened to media content into watchers of media content in the 1950s to the 1980s the emergence of social media has created a nation of media content creators Almost half of Americans use social media as a news source according to the Pew Research Center134 As a participatory platform that allows for usergenerated content135136 and sharing content within ones own virtual network137135 using social media as a news source allows users to engage with news in a variety of ways138 including Consume news Discover news Share or repost news Post their own photos videos or reports of news ie engage in citizen or participatory journalism Comment on news Using social media as a news source has become an increasingly more popular way for old and young adults alike to obtain information There are ways that social media positively affects the world of news and journalism but it is important to acknowledge that there are also ways in which social media has a negative effect on the news that people consume such as false news biased news and disturbing content Social media are used to socialize with friends and family141 pursue romance and flirt141 but not all social needs can be fulfilled by social media142 For example a 2003 article reported that lonely individuals are more likely to use the Internet for emotional support than others143 A 2018 survey from Common Sense Media reported that 40 of American teens ages 1317 thought that social media was extremely or very important for them to connect with their friends144 The same survey reported that 33 of teens said social media was extremely or very important to conduct meaningful conversations with close friends and 23 of teens said social media was extremely or very important to document and share their lives144 A 2020 Gallup poll reported that 53 of adult social media users in the United States thought that social media was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with people during the COVID19 pandemic145 In Alone Together Sherry Turkle considered how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication146 She claimed that people act differently online and are less concerned about hurting others feelings Some online encounters can cause stress and anxiety due to the difficulty purging online posts fear of getting hacked or of universities and employers exploring social media pages Turkle speculated that many people prefer texting to facetoface communication which can contribute to loneliness146 Surveys from 2019 reported evidence among teens in the United States144 and Mexico147 Some researchers reported that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocal messages correlated with less loneliness148 In social media stalking or creeping refers to looking at someones timeline status updates tweets and online bios to find information about them and their activities149 A subcategory of creeping is creeping expartners after a breakup150 Catfishing creating a false identity allows bad actors to exploit the lonely151 Selfpresentation theory proposes that people consciously manage their selfimage or identity related information in social contexts152 One aspect of social media is the time invested in customizing a personal profile153 Some users segment their audiences based on the image they want to present pseudonymity and use of multiple accounts on the same platform offer that opportunity154 A 2016 study reported that teenage girls manipulate their selfpresentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers155 Teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance likes comments and shares When this does not go well selfconfidence and selfsatisfaction can decline155 A 2018 survey of American teens ages 1317 by Common Sense Media reported that 45 said likes are at least somewhat important and 26 at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos144 Some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain156 and some may resort to online bullying157 according to a 2016 study users reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers158 A 2016 review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos selfcomparison disappointment and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved159 One 2016 study reported that Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior160 People portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way155 However upon seeing one persons curated persona other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling One 2017 study reported that problematic social media use ie feeling addicted to social media was related to lower life satisfaction and selfesteem161 Studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health162163 In one study women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction while men reported them as the second biggest factor164 While monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with ones own may increase their impact A 2021 study reported that 87 of women and 65 of men compared themselves to others on social media165 Efforts to combat such negative effects focused promoting body positivity In a related study women aged 1830 were reported posts that contained sidebyside images of women in the same clothes and setting but one image was enhanced for Instagram while the other was an unedited realistic version Women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction166 Social media can offer a support system for adolescent health because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant167 For example in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing obesity treatment participants claimed that social media allowed them to access personalized weightloss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity168169 While social media can provide health information it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information169 The National Eating Disorders Association reported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content169170 Health literacy offers skills to allow users to spotavoid such content Efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success171 Social media such as proanorexia sites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging healthrelated behaviors through social media especially among adolescents172173174 During the coronavirus pandemic inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media175 Topics subject to distortion included treatments avoiding infection vaccination and public policy Simultaneously governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy176 Heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories leading to worse mental health177 and less compliance with public health recommendations178 Social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addictionrelated behaviors with studies report that excessive use can lead to addictionlike symptoms These symptoms include compulsive checking mood modification and withdrawal when not using social media which can result in decreased facetoface social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness179 A 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media It concluded that blue light from computerphone displaysand the frequency rather than the duration of time spent predicted disturbed sleep termed obsessive checking183 The association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults184 A recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance The median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61 Females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance185 Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones and this left them tired and unfocused in school186 A 2011 study reported that time spent on Facebook was negatively associated with GPA but the association with sleep disturbance was not established187 One studied effect of social media is Facebook depression which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media8 This may lead to reclusiveness which can increase loneliness and low selfesteem8 Social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling184 Studies report childrens selfesteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments This affected selfperception188 A 2017 study of almost 6000 adolescent students reported that those who selfreported addictionlike symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low selfesteem and high levels of depressive symptoms189 A second emotional effect is social media burnout defined as ambivalence emotional exhaustion and depersonalization Ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media Emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media Depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media The three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media190 A third emotional effect is fear of missing out FOMO which is the pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent191 It is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media191 Social media can also offer support as Twitter has done for the medical community192 X facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes comments and posts193 Access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones194 Some commentators refer to social media as antisocial media when describing its social impact195196 The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology including smartphones tablets laptops and the internet197198 The digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources In the Information Age people without access to the Internet and other technology are at a disadvantage for they are unable or less able to connect with others find and apply for jobs shop and learn197199 Many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content204205 Because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure Political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them206 Aviv Ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content207 but could be designed to reduce polarization instead208 In 2017 Facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity misinformation and lowquality news209 Some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts210211207 Some advocate for media literacy as a solution212 Others argue that less social media206 or more local journalism213214215 could help address political polarization A 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes216 Stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations For example during the COVID19 pandemic youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease217 Elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media218 Social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication despite different ways of communicating in various cultures219 Social media has affected the way youth communicate by introducing new forms of language220 Novel acronyms save time as illustrated by LOL which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud The hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others Hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion221 For some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills222 What is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media223 The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that bullying the making of noninclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages Sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk224225226227 However adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online228 Social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities8 This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it  July 2024 In July 2014 in response to WikiLeaks release of a secret suppression order made by the Victorian Supreme Court media lawyers were quoted in the Australian media to the effect that anyone who tweets a link to the WikiLeaks report posts it on Facebook or shares it in any way online could also face charges229 On 27 July 2020 in Egypt two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting TikTok videos which the government claimed as violating family values230 In the 2014 Thai coup dtat the public was explicitly instructed not to share or like dissenting views on social media or face prisoncitation needed Historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented They set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore The US enacted the Communications Decency Act in 1996 Section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 47 USC  230c1 In 2024 legislation was enacted in Florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14 and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval231232 The European Union initially took a similar approach233 However in 2020 the European Commission presented two legislative proposals The Digital Services Act DSA and the Digital Markets Act DMA Both proposals were enacted in July 2022 The DSA entered into force on 17 February 2024 the DMA in March 2024234 This legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by MEPs What is illegal offline must also be illegal online235 Very large online platforms must therefore among other things delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 Violators could face a complete ban in Europe or fines of up to 6 of global sales Such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers237 Enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance238 The DSA allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction According to Patrick Breyer from the German Pirate Party a problem could arise from the Hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of Victor Orban as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied EUwide239 2018 Nobel Laureate Paul Romer240 advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms237 Similar to a carbon tax  negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms241 Assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them However consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax  Another proposal is to invoke competition law242 The idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law This would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines In a 2024 opinion piece Megan Moreno and Jenny Radesky professors of pediatrics wrote about the need for nuanced policy243 They regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful They commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages244 In June 2024 US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people245 The business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers Platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them This strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see Platforms such as X add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues246 The enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy Criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability247 impact on concentration mental health248 content ownership and the meaning of interactions and poor crossplatform interoperability249 decrease in facetoface interactions cyberbullying sexual predation particularly of children and child pornography250251 In 2007 Andrew Keen wrote Out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated Under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering252 Social media has become a regular source of news and information A 2021 Pew Research Center poll reported roughly 70 of users regularly get news from social media4 despite the presence of fake news and misinformation Platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy and many do not vet content at all although in some cases content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced253254255 Content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance responding instead to the contents virality In 2018 researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70 faster than truthful news on X7 Social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users10 Some platforms attempt to discover and block bots with limited success11 Fake news seems to receive more user engagement possibly because it is relatively novel engaging users curiosity and increasing spread23 Fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event before conventional media are prepared to publish2016 Social media mining is the process of obtaining data from usergenerated content on social media in order to extract actionable patterns form conclusions about users and act upon the information Mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research The term is an analogy to the process of mining for minerals Mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals likewise social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage online behaviour content sharing connections between individuals buying behaviour These patterns and trends are of interest to companies governments and notforprofit organizations as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies introduce programs products processes or services Social media mining uses concepts from computer science data mining machine learning and statistics Mining is based on social network analysis network science sociology ethnography optimization and mathematics It attempts to formally represent measure and model patterns from social media data256 In the 2010s major corporations governments and notforprofit organizations began mining to learn about customers clients and others Platforms such as Google Facebook partnered with Datalogix and BlueKai conduct mining to target users with advertising257 Scientists and machine learning researchers extract insights and design product features258 Users may not understand how platforms use their data259 Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements without reading them leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users privacy Malcolm Gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated He concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves that expression likely has no impact beyond social media What he called highrisk activism involves strong relationships coordination commitment high risks and sacrifice261 Gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that social networks are effective at increasing participationby lessening the level of motivation that participation requires261 According to him Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice261 Disputing Gladwells theory a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity262 Social media content is generated by users However content ownership is defined by the Terms of Service to which users agree Platforms control access to the content and may make it available to third parties263 Although platforms terms differ generally they all give permission to utilize users copyrighted works at the platforms discretion264 After its acquisition by Facebook in 2012 Instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users265266 It then reversed these changes with thenCEO Kevin Systrom promising to update the terms of service267268 Privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data Information is captured without the users knowing consent Data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes269263 Information may be offered for third party use Young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators270 While social media users claim to want to keep their data private their behavior does not reflect that concern as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles In addition platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles This data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising271 A 2014 Pew Research Center survey reported that 91 of Americans agree or strongly agree that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used Some 80 of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms and 64 said the government should do more to regulate advertisers272 In 2019 UK legislators criticized Facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data273 In 2019 the Pentagon issued guidance to the military Coast Guard and other government agencies that identified the potential risk associated with using the TikTok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information274 As a result the military Coast Guard Transportation Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security banned the installation and use of TikTok on government devices275 In 2020 The US government attempted to ban TikTok and WeChat from the States over national security concerns However a federal court blocked the move276 In 2024 the US Congress passed a low directing TikToks parent company ByteDance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the US The company sued challenging the constitutionality of the ban277 Internet addiction disorder IAD also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use is a problematic compulsive use of the internet particularly on social media that impairs an individuals function over a prolonged period of time Young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder278 with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online279 Some experience health consequences from loss of sleep280 as they stay up to continue scrolling chatting and gaming281 Excessive Internet use is not recognized as a disorder by the World Health Organization the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 or the International Classification of Diseases ICD11282 However gaming disorder appears in the ICD11283 Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders Definitions are not standardized or agreed upon complicating the development of evidencebased recommendations Users under 30 access the Internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse284 In 2011 the term Facebook addiction disorder FAD emerged285 FAD is characterized by compulsive use of Facebook A 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use and narcissism reporting FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables depression anxiety and stress symptoms286287 In 2020 the documentary The Social Dilemma reported concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social medias pursuit of addictive use For example when a user has not visited Facebook for some time the platform varies its notifications attempting to lure them back It also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality288 Whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous291 A study of Americans aged 1215 reported that teenagers who used social media over three hoursday doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety292 Platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content A 2023 study of Australian youth reported that 57 had seen disturbingly violent content while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images293 Further youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullyingcitation needed As result phones have been banned from some schools and some schools in the US have blocked social media websites294 Social media often features in political struggles In some countries Internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens use of social media For example in 2013 some social media was banned in Turkey after the Taksim Gezi Park protests Both X and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a courts decision A law granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate TB personnel The TB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order295 Yet TBs 2014 blocking of X was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech296 Internet censorship in the United States is the suppression of information published or viewed on the Internet in the United States The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal state and local government censorship Free speech protections allow little governmentmandated Internet content restrictions However the Internet is highly regulated supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms297 Gambling cyber security and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the US297 Many governmentmandated attempts to regulate content have been barred often after lengthy legal battles298 However the government has exerted pressure indirectly With the exception of child pornography content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to removesuppress content following state encouragement or the threat of legal action299297 While the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable open source protocols such as ActivityPub have been adopted by platforms such as Mastodon GNU social Diaspora and Friendica They operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteeroperated servers called the Fediverse However in 2019 Mastodon blocked Gab from connecting to it claiming that it spread violent rightwing extremism305 In December 2019 X CEO Jack Dorsey advocated an open and decentralized standard for social media He joined Bluesky to bring it to reality306 Deplatforming also called noplatforming is a form of Internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their informationideas This typically involves suspension outright bans or reducing spread shadow banning307308 A number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on311 Zack Beauchamp of Vox calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats312 The Economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats313 Informed dialogue a shared sense of reality mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media314 Political polarization can be one byproduct315316317 This has implications for the likelihood of political violence318206 Siva Vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing antitrust laws195 Andrew Leonard describes Polis as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus319320 According to LikeWar The Weaponization of Social Media321 the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities corporations and governments but also extremist groups322 The use of social media by ISIS and AlQaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers Social media platforms and encryptedmessaging applications have been used to recruit members both locally and internationally323 Platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content Extreme nationalist groups and more prominently US rightwing extremists have used similar online tactics As many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech several platforms became popular among rightwing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events these application became known as Alttech Platforms such as Telegram Parler and Gab were used during the January 6 United States Capitol attack to coordinate attacks324 Members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians325 Social media content persists unless the user deletes it After a user dies unless the platform is notified their content remains326 Each platform has created guidelines for this situation327 In most cases on social media the platforms require a nextofkin to prove that the user is deceased and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a legacy status X328 The company works with an immediate family member to deactivate the account Additionally X will not give the account to any other person regardless of the relationship Facebook Users have the option of having their account permanently deleted after death Users can identify a legacy contact who would take over the account after Instagram329 Users can have the account memorialized or deleted with proof of death LinkedIn330 A family member can request that the account be deleted The family member must identify the account submit proof of relationship the users email address date of death a link to the obituary and the name of the last company the deceased worked for Pinterest Must email the company with the URL of the account along with a death certificate or a link to the obituary as well as proof of relationship to the deceased YouTube331 A representative can close the account transfer payments from the account to an immediate family member and legal representative of the users estate and can provide the data in the account to a family member All three capabilities require the

recommendation entitled Notation for national and international telephone numbers email addresses and Web addresses Recommendation E123 specifies the format of telephone numbers assigned to telephones and similar communication endpoints in national telephone numbering plans In examples a numeric digit is used only if the digit is the same in every number and letters to illustrate groups X is used as a wildcard character to represent any digit in lists of numbers All telephone numbers in Djibouti have eight digits Fixed line numbers start with 21 or 27 then a fixed line locality code followed by four digits Mobile numbers start with 77 then a mobile line locality code followed by four digits With the country code of Djibouti 253 the international format is 253 XX YY ZZZZ All telephone numbers in Morocco have ten digits initial 0 plus nine numbers Landline numbers start with 05 followed by two digits for the regional area RR then two digits for the local area LL then 4 digits for the subscriber number XX XX 05 RR LL XX XX or 05RR LL XX XX Mobile numbers start with 06 or 07 followed by the subscriber number 06 XX XX XX XX or 07 XX XX XX XX The country code for Morocco is 212 so the format becomes 212 Y XX XX XX XX or 212 YXX XX XX XX also 212 YXXXXXXXX as well where Y is 5 for landlines or 67 for mobile Free calling numbers green numbers or call center numbers start with 080 or 090 Telephone numbers in Kenya use a 9digit format The nine digits used for local calls start with a 0 trunk prefix for domestic calls followed by the 3digit areaprovider code and the final six digits 07XX XXX XXX The international code for Kenya is 254 South Africa uses 10digit dialling which has been required since 16 January 2007 The ten digits used for local calls AAA XXX XXXX or 0AA XXX XXXX consist of a 3digit areatype code the first digit in the areatype code is a trunk prefix followed by seven digits All area codes including mobile numbers start with a 0 trunk prefix for domestic calls When dialing from another country the country code for South Africa is 27 with the rest of the digits excluding the 0 trunk prefix 27 AA XXX XXXX Telephone numbers in China have 10 or 11 digits excluding an initial zero which is required at times and fall in at least four distinct categories Landlines In China the length of phone numbers varies from city to city It is usually written as 0XXX YYY YYYY For landlines registered in large metropolises it is written in the format 0XXX YYYY YYYY where 0 is the trunk code XXX is the area code 2 or 3 digits and YYYY YYYY is the local number 7 or 8 digits For example 0755 XXXX YYYY indicates a Shenzhen number XXXXYYYY is dialed locally 0755 XXXX YYYY is dialed in other areas inside the country while for international calls to Shenzhen the 0 is dropped and is written 86 755 XXXX YYYY Mobiles The 11digit code is always written in full in the whole China eg 1WX YYYY ZZZZ Each WX is assigned to a service provider while W is usually 3 through 9 The remaining eight digits are the subscriber number Toll Free These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 800 or 400 800 tollfree are accessible only when called from landline phones while 400 shared toll are accessible from all phones 400 XXX XXXX or 800 XXXX XXXX Service numbers These are usually 3 to 5digit numbers eg Police is 110 used to access an emergency service Fire 119 Ambulance 120 Police 110 Roadside assistance 12122 or a valueadded service Every number except special service numbers is an 8digit number they are grouped as XXXX YYYY There are no area codes Telephone numbers in India have ten digits excluding an initial zero which is required at times and fall into at least four distinct categories Landlines Written as AAABBBBBBB where AAA is the Subscriber Trunk Dialing code longdistance code and BBBBBBB is the phone number The total length of the Subscriber Trunk Dialing code and the phone number is ten digits The Subscriber Trunk Dialing code can have from two digits 11 or 011 up to four digits Mobiles Written as AAAAABBBBB for ease of remembering though the prefix is either 2digits or 4digits in the numbering plan Mobile numbers which are not local need to be prefixed by a 0 while dialing or by 91 91 is the country code for India A mobile number written as 91AAAAA BBBBB is valid throughout India and in other countries where the  is recognized as a prefix to the country code Since 2015 calls from mobile phones to any other mobiles do not need to prefix with a 0 However calls from landlines to nonlocal mobile numbers need to be prefixed with 0 Toll Free These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 1800 Sometimes they are accessible or are tollfree only when called from the governmentowned telephone corporation BSNLMTNL Service numbers These are usually three or four digit numbers eg Police is 100 used to access an emergency service Fire Ambulance Police Roadside assistance or a valueadded service All telephone numbers in Iran have 11 digits initial 0 and ten digits The first two or three digits after the zero are the area code The possibilities are 0xx xxxx xxxx for landlines 09xx xxx xxxx for cellphones and 099xx xxx xxx for MVNO When making a call within the same landline area code initial 0 plus the area code must be omitted An example for calling telephones in the city of Tehran is as follows xxxx xxxx within Tehran via a landline 021 xxxx xxxx Outside Tehran or via a cellphone 98 21 xxxx xxxx outside Iran An example for mobile numbers is as follows 09xx xxx xxxx in Iran 98 9xx xxx xxxx outside Iran The traditional convention for phone numbers is 0AA NXXXXXX where 0AA is the area code and NXXXXXX is the subscriber number This number format is very similar to the North American numbering plan but the country has a trunk code of 0 instead of 1 so international callers using 81 do not have to dial the trunk code 0 when calling to Japan Telephone numbers had nine digits in Tokyo and Osaka until the late 1990s when a seventh digit was added to the subscriber number Densely populated areas have shorter area codes while rural areas have longer area codes but the last two digits of a fivedigit area code including the first zero may also be the first two digits of the subscriber number Area codes increase from north to south except in areas such as the western Hokuriku region and the prefecture of Okinawa where area codes increase from west to east or south to north Some telephone numbers deviate from this rule Tollfree dialing and Navi Dial operations 0120XXXXXX 0570XXXXXX or 0800XXXXXX where XXXXXX is the subscriber number The area code 050 uses an 11 digit phone number 050XXXXXXXX where XXXXXXXX is the subscriber number 110 and 119 are examples of three digit emergency numbers All area codes including mobile start with a 0 trunk prefix for domestic calls If you are dialing from another country the international calling code for Malaysia is 60 which may be confusing do not dial an extra 0 before the rest of the digits For fixed line and mobile phone numbers a dash is written in between the areamobile code and the subscriber number with an optional space before the last four digits of the subscriber number For example a fixed line number in Kuala Lumpur is written as 03XXXX YYYY or 03XXXXYYYY while a fixed line number in Kota Kinabalu is written as 088XX YYYY or 088XXYYYY A typical mobile phone number is written as 01MXXX YYYY or 01MXXXYYYY Tollfree and local charge numbers are written as 1800XXYYYY and 1300XXYYYY respectively while premium rate numbers are written as 600XXYYYY Telephone numbers in Pakistan have two parts Area codes in Pakistan have from two to five digits the smaller the city the longer the prefix All the large cities have twodigit codes Smaller towns have a six digit number Large cities have sevendigit numbers Azad Jammu and Kashmir has five digit numbers On 1 July 2009 telephone numbers in Karachi and Lahore were changed from seven digits to eight digits This was accomplished by adding the digit 9 to the beginning of any phone number that started with a 9 government and semigovernment connections and adding the digit 3 to any phone numbers that did not start with the number 91 It is common to write phone numbers as 0xx yyyyyyy where xx is the area code The 0 prefix is for trunk longdistance dialing from within the country International callers should dial 92 xx yyyyyyyy All mobile phone codes have four digits and start with 03xx All mobile numbers have seven digits and denote the mobile provider on a nationwide basis and not geographic location Thus all Telenor numbers for example nationwide carry mobile code 0345 etc Universal access number 111 xxx xxx Emergency Service Numbers 1xx 1xxx Premium Rate services 0900 xxxxx Toll free numbers For callers within Pakistan 0800 xxxxx Landline numbers are eleven digits long2 and written as 63 XX YYY ZZZZ for international callers For domestic calls the country code 63 is omitted and a trunk prefix 0 is placed For local calls both the trunk prefix 0 and the area code are omitted Mobile numbers are twelve digits long3 and written as 63 XXX YYY ZZZZ or 0 XXX YYY ZZZZ In Singapore every phone number is written as 65XXXXYYYY or 65 XXXX YYYY Mobile phones starts with 89 landline phone numbers starts with 6 while VOIP numbers starts with 3 Subscriber numbers have eight digits and there are no area codes Except for short codes and emergency numbers all telephone numbers in Sri Lanka have ten digits initial 0  nine numbers Landline phone numbers begin with the area code then one digit for the operator code then six digits for the primary telephone number Format XXX Y ZZZZZZ where xxx denotes the area code All area codes begin with the number 0 The operator code for fixed landline numbers is y zzzzzz denotes the primary telephone number which has six digits Mobile numbers start with the mobile operator code which begins from 07X followed by seven digits for the main telephone number Format XXX ZZZZZZZ where When dialing a mobile number xxx represents the mobile operator code All mobile operator codes begin with the number 07 zzzzzzz represents the main telephone number of seven digits The country code for Sri Lanka is 94 so the format becomes 94 XX Y ZZZZZZ for landlines and the format becomes 94 XX ZZZZZZZ for mobile numbers4 South Korean phone numbers can be as short as seven digits and as long as 11 digits because when making a local call ie in the same city there is no need to dial the area code South Korean area codes are assigned based on city Landline home numbers are usually written as 0XXXXXXXXX or 0XX XXXXXXX where 0XX indicates an area code 0XX XXXXXX and 0XX XXX XXXX without hyphens are comprehensible as well The area code may have two digits for some cities such as Seoul and Gwacheon these two cities use the same area code and three digits for other cities such as Incheon Busan and most of the cities in Gyeonggido The middle threedigit part is extended to four digits in many areas due to the increased number of telephone users In the international context 82 0XXXXXXXXX is commonly used as well For international calls 0 in the area code is often omitted because it is not necessary to dial 0 from foreign countries Therefore it is better written as 820XXXXXXXXX or 820XXXXXXXXXX The plus  sign is often added to the country code eg 82 0XXXXXXXXX or 820XXXXXXXXXX For mobile numbers 016490641 so on As with the landline home numbers the mobile numbers middle threedigit part is extended to four digits eg 016490641 due to the increased number of mobile phone users If a number starts with 070 the number does not belong to any particular area and is a number given by an Internet telephone service In this case 070 is not usually put in the brackets neither   nor  In the business context the numbers in the format of 15XXXXXX and 16XXXXXX are business representative agency or customer services While the numbers starting with 080 eg 080XXXXXXX are also businessrelated numbers but are usually tollfree customer service centers Also in this case 15XX 16XX or 070 are not put in the brackets neither   nor  There are national telephone services which have phone numbers in the format of 1XX or 1XXX without any area code For example 114 is for telephone yellow page 119 is for fireemergency number 112 is for police station center 131 is for weather forecast information 1333 is for traffic information and so on The number 111 is for reporting spies especially from North Korea It used to be 113 so most of senior citizen still believe it is the number for reporting spies These numbers do not need any brackets If there are multiple numbers used for one personentity the symbol  is usually used to avoid repetitions For example if one company has three phone numbers0311111111 0311111112 and 0311111113then they are shortened as in 03111111113 If the numbers are not consecutive then the last digit is written together with commas For example if a company has three numbers0311111111 0311111115 0311111119 then they are shortened as in 0311111111 5 9 Landline numbers in Taiwan are written with the area code in parentheses with phone numbers total nine digits Example 02 XXXX YYYY for phone numbers in Taipei area Mobile phones have 3 digit company code assigned to different mobile service carriers such as 09 XXXXXX followed by a 6 digit phone number note Mobile carriers could have multiple company codes All numbers in Thailand whether for landlines or mobile reception consist of eight digits xxxx xxxx in the governments official format When calling domestically landline numbers are preceded by a zero 0 xxxx xxxx example 0 5381 0595 while mobile numbers are preceded by 0 plus one digit 0x xxxx xxxx example 06 9756 4509 Thais often confuse the current numbering system with the old provincial area code system which no longer exists as area codes were integrated into all phone numbers in 2005 Because of this unofficially people often write numbers as 0xx xxx xxx 053 810 595 Calling a Thai phone number from outside Thailand one drops the 0 and adds the 66 country code Example 66 5381 05955 Most Australian telephone numbers have ten digits and are generally written 0A BBBB BBBB or 04XX XXX XXX for mobile telephone numbers where 0A is the optional area code 2378 and BBBB BBBB is the subscriber number   When the number is to be seen by an international audience it is written 61 A BBBB BBBB or 61 4XX XXX XXX When written for a local audience the optional area code is omitted The area code is often written within parentheses 0A BBBB BBBB Mobile numbers should never have parentheses Tendigit nongeographic numbers beginning with 1 are written 1X0Y BBB BBB where X  8 for toll free numbers X  3 for fixedfee numbers and X  9 for premium services Sixdigit nongeographic numbers are written 13 BB BB or 13B BBB these are fixedfee numbers Sevendigit 180 BBBB numbers also exist Bs are sometimes written as letters Almost all New Zealand telephone numbers have seven digits with a singledigit access code and a singledigit area code for longdistance domestic calls Traditionally the number was given as 0A BBBBBBB with the two first digits the STD code often omitted for local calls The brackets and the dash are also often omitted Mobile numbers follow the same format but with the area code being two digits ie 02M BBBBBBB  Some mobile numbers are longer 02102BBBBBB 02108BBBBBB 02040BBBBBB 020 41BBBBBB and 028 25BBBBBB and some are shorter 0213BBBBB 0214BBBBB 0215BBBBB 0216BBBBB 0217BBBBB 0218BBBBB and 0219BBBBB There are also freephone numbers starting with 0800 or 0508 that are given in the format 0800AAAAAA It is not uncommon for the 0800 and 0508 to be enclosed in brackets although this is not strictly correct as the brackets denote optional parts of the number and the 0800 and 0508 is required6 Recently with 8 digit mobile numbers becoming more common the prefix4 digits4 digits format has been adopted for readability 022 1234 5678 For international use the prefix 64 is substituted for the leading zero giving 64ABBBBBBB for landlines and 64MMBBBBBBB for mobile numbers Belgian telephone numbers consist of three parts First 0 secondly the zone prefix A which has one or two digits for landlines and three digits for mobile phones and thirdly the subscribers number B Land lines always have nine digits They are prefixed by a zero followed by the zone prefix Depending on the length of the zone prefix the subscribers number consists of either 6 or 7 digits Hence land line numbers are written either 0AA BB BB BB or 0A BBB BB BB Mobile phone numbers always consist of ten digits The first digit of the zone prefix of a mobile number is always 4 Then follows 2 digits indicating to which Mobile Operators pool the number originally belonged when it was taken into usage The fourth digit represents a subgroup of this pool and has no additional meaning other than increasing the amount of possible numbers The subscribers number consists of six digits Hence mobile phone numbers are written 04AA BB BB BB Sometimes the last six digits are written in two groups of 3 digits to increase readability 04AA BBB BBB Numbers are sometimes written with a slash in between the zone prefix and the subscribers number This is the case for both land lines and mobile phone numbers Sometimes dots are written between the blocks of the subscribers number Examples 0AABB BB BB 0AABBBBBB for mobile numbers 04AABB BB BB 04AABBBBBB or 04AABBBBBB The international code prefix for Belgium is 32 When dialing a number with the prefix the 0 can be dropped eg 32 9055 Danish telephone numbers have eight digits and are normally written in four groups of two digits each with the groups separated by spaces AA AA AA AA in two groups of four digits each with the groups separated by a space AAAA AAAA in one group of two digits followed by two groups of three digits each with the groups separated by spaces AA AAA AAA or all in one go AAAAAAAA The third option AA AAA AAA is not commonly used for personal landline or mobile numbers but is mostly found in corporate numbers especially in advertizing The standard formats  which when spoken divide numbers into ranges from 00 zero zero to 99 ninetynine  limit the possible range of the ability to create telephone numbers that are easy to remember dividing the numbers into groups of three expands the mnemonic possibilities Danish emergency and service numbers have three digits and are written AAA Danish short numbers used for text messaging services have four digits and are written AAAA French telephone numbers have ten digits usually written in groups of two separated by spaces in the format 0A BB BB BB BB where 0 the trunk prefix was created in 1996 to be a carrier selection code and A is the territorial area code included in the subscriber number A BB BB BB BB Sometimes it is also written in the format 0ABBBBBBBB using periods instead of spaces but this is less common The A territorial area code can be 1 to 5 for geographicbased numbers according to location ParisSuburbs northwest France northeast France southeast France and southwest France respectively and it designates nationwide numbers when it is 6 or 7 mobile numbers 8 special numbers or 9 phone over IP over xDSLnongeographic numbers The numbering plan is a closed one all digits must always be dialed The first two or three B can designate the area old area code for geographic numbers or the operator to whom the number resource belongs There are also short numbers for emergencies such as 112 that are written 1C or 1CC and short numbers for special services written 10 CC 11C CCC or 36 CC 00 is the international access code International format is 33 A BB BB BB BB where the leading trunk prefix 0 disappears it must not be dialed from abroad This format can be directly used in mobile phones German telephone numbers have no fixed length for area code and subscriber number an open numbering plan There are many ways to format a telephone number in Germany The most prominent is DIN 5008 but the international format E123 and Microsofts canonical address format are also very common Trunk access code is 0 and international call prefix code is 00 DIN 5008 0AAAA BBBBBB DIN 5008 with Extension 0AAAA BBBBBBXX DIN 5008 international 49 AAAA BBBBBB E123 local 0AAAA BBBBBB E123 international 49 AAAA BBBBBB Microsoft 49 AAAA BBBBBB Old 0AAAABBBBBB Very old 0AAAABBBBBBXX Numbers are often written in blocks of two Example 49 A AA B BB BB Note the blocks go from right to left The very old format and E123 local form are still in use sometimes for technical reasons Greek telephone numbers have ten digits and usually written AAB BBBBBBB or AAAB BBBBBB where AAB or AAAB is the 2 or 3digit national area code plus the first digit of the subscriber number and BBBBBBB or BBBBBB are the remaining digits of the subscriber number The entire number must always be dialed even if calling within the same local area therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number According to international convention numbers are sometimes written 30 AAB BBBBBBB or 30 AAAB BBBBBB to include the country calling code In Hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two except for Budapest the capital which has the area code 1 Subscribers numbers have six digits in general Numbers in Budapest and cell phone numbers have seven digits Phone numbers in Iceland have seven digits and generally written in the form XXX XXXX or XXXXXXX Phone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan with varying number lengths The area code system is similar to that in some other northern European countries Unlike the UK Irish fixed line numbering is divided into a number of regions which are except Dublin further subdivided in a hierarchical structure with the largest town often but not always taking 0A1 Area codes start with a trunk prefix 0 and extend for up to four digits but usually 3 followed by the local phone number of up to seven digits In industry jargon these area codes and prefixes are referred to as NDCs National Dialing Codes This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents as they include nongeographic codes Historically like the UK the term STD code Subscriber Trunk Dialling was used However the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion Dublin uses the shorter 01 code which is not further subdivided Other cities and major towns usually have codes ending in 1 Cork for example is 021 Galway 091 Limerick 061 etc The leading zero is always omitted when dialling from outside the country Local phone numbers have either 5 6 or 7digits In 7digit numbering they are usually grouped as BBB BBBB 6digit numbers are grouped BBB BBB and 5digit numbers are normally all grouped together BBBBB Grouping of numbers is not strictly adhered to but usually fairly consistent The area code should always be kept separated with a space or surrounded by brackets and not merged into the local number The use of hyphens is discouraged particularly on websites as it can prevent mobile browsers identifying the number as a clickable link for easier dialling Fixed line numbers are normally presented as follows 01 BBB BBBB for a Dublin number 7 digit 021 BBB BBBB for a Cork number 7 digit 064 BBB BBBB for a Killarney number 7 digit 061 BBB BBB for a Limerick number 6 digit 098 BBBBB for a Westport number 5 digit 0404 BBBBB for a Wicklow number 5 digit Area codes may also be surrounded by brackets but this practice is falling out of use as local dialing without the area code is optional on landlines and the area code must always be dialled on mobile phones The Irish telecommunication regulator ComReg has been gradually rationalising area codes by merging and extending local numbering to 7digits in the format 0AA BBB BBBB This is being carried out only where necessary to avoid disruption This means that varying fixed line number lengths will continue to exist in Ireland for the foreseeable future Mobile numbers are presented as follows 08A BBB BBBB Brackets should not be used around the mobile prefix as it is never optional and must always be dialled even from another phone with the same prefix Special rate numbers such as free phonetoll free and premium rate are usually grouped Freephone 1800 BB BB BB or spoken as oneeighthundred Local rate 1850 BB BB BB eighteenfifty 1550 BB BB BB read as fifteenfifty However for memorability this is not consistently adhered to Alphanumeric characters can also be used in presenting numbers for added memorability but it is much less common than in North America For example 18AA 99 TAXI Note These special rate numbers are not reachable from outside Ireland7 Phone numbers in Italy have variable length Theres no well established convention about how to group digits or which symbol to use but this is hardly an issue since all the digits are always dialed Since 10 October 1995 Operation Decibel all telephone numbers in the Netherlands have ten digits including the trunk prefix 0 The area code A is commonly separated with a dash  and sometimes a space from the subscribers number B Alternatively the area code including the trunk prefix can be enclosed in parentheses The length of the area code for landlines is either 2 or 3 digits depending on the population density of the area This leaves 7 or 6 digits for the subscribers number resulting in a format of either 0AABBBBBBB or 0AAABBBBBB Cellphone numbers are assigned the 1digit area code 6 leaving eight digits for the subscribers number 06CBBBBBBB where subscribers number C is neither 6 nor 7 Service numbers area codes 800 900 906 and 909 have either 4 or 7 remaining digits making them 8 or 11 digits in total 0AAABBBB or 0AAABBBBBBB The area code 14 has no trunk prefix and is used for government numbers currently only for municipalities The remaining digits represent the area code of the municipality Therefore the length 14 numbers total either 5 or 6 digits 14 0AA or 14 0AAA The trunk prefix 0 is dropped when prefixed by the country code 31 AA BBBBBBBB 31 6 CBBBBBBB etcetera Note that there is not a trunk prefix for the 14 series so the international number becomes 31 14 0AAA Norwegian telephone numbers have eight digits A number to a fixed line is written in four groups of two separated by spaces AA AA AA AA Phone numbers in the 8xx series are written in three groups AAA AA AAA This makes it easy to determine if the Bnumber is SMS capable Mobile numbers start with 4 or 9 Telephone numbers in Poland have nine digits For mobile phones the preferred format is AAAAAAAAA For landline phones the preferred format is AABBBBBBB where AA is area code Occasionally you can encounter numbers formatted as AA BBBBBBB Omitting area code is not permitted because nowadays it is always required Telephone numbers in Portugal have nine digits A number to a fixed line is written in three groups of two separated by spaces AAA AAA AAA Cellphone numbers are written in three groups AAA AAA AAA Mobile numbers start with 9 Starting with 2002 phone numbers in Romania have ten digits the first digit always being 0 The preferred format is AAAAAAAAAA for mobile except for landline phones in Bucharest where the preferred format is AAAAAAAAAA Russia has an open numbering plan with 10digit phone numbers Trunk prefix is 8 or 8CC when using alternative operators where CC is 2123 5255 International call prefix is 810 or 8CC when using alternative operators where CC is 2629 5659 The country code is 7 Length of geographical area codes A is usually 3 to 5 digits length of nongeographical area codes is 3 The groups of digits in the local subscribers number B are separated by dashes  BBBBBBB BBBBBB BBBBB The area code is included in parentheses similarly to E123 local notation AAA BBBBBBB AAAA BBBBBB AAAAA BBBBB Area code dialing is optional in most geographical area codes except Moscow area codes 495 498 499 it is mandatory for nongeographical area codes E123 international and Microsoft formats are used for writing local phone numbers as well international prefix and country code 7 are replaced with trunk code 8 or 8CC when dialing a mandatory area code Even though trunk code is not needed for calls within the same geographical area recent convention adds the default trunk code to the phone number notation 8 AAAA BBBBBB For mandatory area code dealing plans notation 8 AAAA BBBBBB is used These formats are a mix of Microsoft format and E123 local notation Mobile phones require full 10digit number which starts with 3digit nongeographical area codes 900990 For international calls abroad or international roaming calls to Russia E123 international notation with an international call prefix  is the only allowed calling number format For local calls both 8 and 7 are accepted as a trunk code Old BBBBBBB Old with area code AAA BBBBBBB Conventional 8 AAA BBBBBBB Microsoft 7 AAA BBBBBBB Conventional mandatory area code 8 AAA BBBBBBB E123 international 7 AAA BBB BB BB Spanish telephone numbers have nine digits starting with 9 or 8 for fixed lines excluding 90x and 80x or with 6 or 7 for mobile phones The first group in fixed lines always identifies the dialed province That group might be of 2 or 3 digits for example 91 and 81 are for Madrid while 925 and 825 are for Toledo The second group is always of 3 digits as it formerly identified the telephone exchange it now identifies the telephone area When the first group has two digits as in Madrid the number is usually written in four groups of 2322 digits AB CCC DD DD When the first group has three digits as in Toledo the number is usually written in 3 groups of 3 digits ABB CCC DDD but the form 3222 ABB CC CD DD is not uncommon Mobile numbers are usually grouped by threes ABB CCC CCC but the form 3222 is also seen Swedish telephone numbers have between eight and ten digits They start with a two to four digit area code A three digit code starting with 07 indicates that the number is for a mobile phone All national numbers start with one leading 0 and international destinations are specified by the prefix 00 or  The numbers are written with the area code followed by a hyphen and then two to three groups of digits separated by spaces8 National 10 digit 0AXXX XXX XX 0AAXXX XX XX 0AAAXX XX XX 0AXXX XXX XX

0AA is the national destination code and BBB BB BB is the subscriber number The entire number must always be dialed including the leading 0 even if calling within a local area therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number According to international convention numbers are sometimes written 41 AA BBB BB BB to include the country calling code Certain nationwide destination codes such as for tollfree or premiumrate telephone numbers are written 0800 BBB BBB or 0900 BBB BBB Short numbers are used for emergency services such as 112 that are written 1CC or 1CCC In Turkey the format for telephone numbers is commonly seen as 0BBB AAA AA AA While landline numbers having the prefix 02BB AAA AA AA 03BB AAA AA AA or 04BB AAA AA AA9 mobile numbers have the prefix 05BB AAA AA AA Landline area codes are separated by cities and only one city Istanbul has two area codes 216 for the Asian side and 212 for the European side Mobile numbers however are separated by carriers There are three mobile carriers in Turkey Vodafone TR Turkcell and Turk Telekom Turkcell has the prefix 053B AAA AA AA Vodafone TR has the prefix 054B AAA AA AA and Turk Telekom has the prefix 055B AAA AA AA Since 9 November 2008 with the passing of the Number Carriability Regulation by ICTA mobile numbers can be carried from one mobile carrier to the other without having to change the prefix10 This caused dialing 05BB to call another number on the same carrier to become mandatory Calls to numbers which were carried to another operator are signaled by a unique sound upon dialing to signify that the recipient is on another network and alert them against potentially unwanted interconnection charges The same regulation passed on 10 September 2009 regarding landline numbers without the requirement to dial the prefix among numbers with the same geographical area sharing the same prefix The 0 on every prefix is an Area Code Exit code that must be dialed when a number with a different area code is being called So when calling from outside of Turkey those 0s are not dialed The dialing format when calling from outside Turkey is 90 BBB AAA AA AA and NOT 90 0BBB AAA AA AA Unlike the North American system the Country Exit Code isnt 011 but 00 So it is one 0 to exit area and one more 0 to exit the country There are many recommendations for recording phone numbers The most common in the world is Recommendation E123 E123 International Telecommunication Union11 and the standard format for Microsoft telephone numbers Microsoft12 There is an international format for recording a telephone number containing the country code settlement code and telephone number and the national format containing the settlement code and telephone number To record Ukrainian telephone numbers telephone codes for settlements do not have an initial zero longdistance prefix 0 380 44 123 45 67 E123 international format country code settlement code and telephone number are separated by spaces 044 123 45 67 E123 national format longdistance prefix and city code in parentheses national format longdistance prefix and settlement code in parentheses due to possible confusion needs constant additional clarification  28 11  the phone number is separated from the code and separated by spaces 380 44 1234567 Microsoft international format country code space code settlement code in brackets space code telephone number Dialling codes also known as area codes are optional for local callers often surrounded by parentheses or separated with a dash though there are trials running to make them mandatory13 and are followed by the customers telephone number Codes with the form 02x are followed by 8digit local numbers and are usually written as 02x AAAA AAAA or 02x AAAA AAAA Area codes with the form 011x or 01x1 are used for many of the major population centres in the UK are always followed by 7digit local numbers and are usually written as 01xx AAA BBBB 01xx AAA BBBB or 01x1AAA BBBB the latter formerly the recommended format for six major metropolitan areas in the UK Other area codes have the form 01xxx with 5 or 6 figure local numbers written as 01xxx or 01xxx followed by subscriber number AAAAA or AAAAAA or have the form 01xx xx with 4 or 5 figure local numbers written as 01xx xx or 01xx xx followed by subscriber number AAAA or AAAAA Numbers for mobile phones and pagers are formatted as 07AAA BBBBBB and most other nongeographic numbers are 10 figures in length excluding trunk digit 0 and formatted as 0AAA BBB BBBB However these numbers are sometimes written in other formats 9 figure freephone numbers are 0500 AAAAAA and 0800 AAAAAA and there is one number of 8 figures length 0800 1111 Childline Domestically there are also a number of special service numbers such as 100 for the operator 123 for the speaking clock and 155 for the international operator as well as 118 AAA for various directory enquiry services and 116 AAA for various helplines For some services the number you call will depend on which operator you use to connect the call 112 and 999 work for calling the emergency services These numbers cannot be called from abroad When calling from abroad the initial 0 trunk prefix is not required it is however commonplace to represent telephone numbers with both the international code and the 0 trunk prefix  which is typically placed within parentheses  but this representation is inconsistent with the E123 international standard14 Twentyfour countries and territories share the North American Numbering Plan NANP with a single country code 1 The formatting convention for telephone numbers is NPA NXXXXXX where NPA is the threedigit area code and NXXXXXX is the sevendigit subscriber number15 NPA has the same syntax of NXX since the implementation of interchangeable area codes in 1995 The prefix NXX of the subscriber number is the central office code unique in the numbering plan area The place holder N stands for the digits 2 to 9 as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1 It is a closed telephone numbering plan in which all subscriber telephone numbers have seven digits in addition to the threedigit area code Under allnumber calling a numbering plan introduced around 1960 local calls within an area code were placed by dialing NXXXXXX omitting the area code known as sevendigit dialing Only calling a destination in a different area code required dialing the destination area code known as tendigit dialing Due to the need for a larger telephone number pool in many regions sevendigit dialing is becoming rare in the United States With the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century many metropolitan areas saw the introduction of additional area codes Multiple area codes were assigned to the same numbering plan area a configuration known as an overlay numbering plan Calls within an overlay are still local calls despite the need for tendigit dialing In general placing longdistance calls requires dialing the trunk code 1 but this may be optional in some areas Canada is a member of the North American Numbering Plan but administers its numbering resources individually under guidance from the NANP Administrator The Canadian government has stated on its Language Portal of Canada that telephone numbers are to be written with a hyphen between each sequence as follows 1NPANXXXXXX or NPANXXXXXX16 10digit dialing is now required throughout most of Canada including all of British Columbia Alberta Saskatchewan Manitoba Quebec Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island as well as most of Ontario Areas not yet requiring 10digit dialing are Ontarios 807 area code Newfoundland and Labrador New Brunswick the Yukon Northwest Territories and Nunavut although 10digit dialing may be accepted in some of these areas In the province of Qubec where French is the first language the Office qubcois de la langue franaise has established that telephone numbers must be written with spaces first and then a hyphen for the last sequence as follows 1 NPA NXXXXXX17 Mexican telephone numbers have ten digits They can consist of a twodigit NN area code and an eightdigit local number ABCD XXXX or a threedigit area code NNN with a sevendigit local number ABC XXXX As of August 3 2019 all the indicators and access codes 01 044 045 are deprecated therefore all telephone numbers for landline or mobile service are dialed with ten digits18 The formatting convention of a telephone number is ABCD XXXX or NN ABCD XXXX or NN ABCDXXXX ABC XX XX or NNN ABC XXXX or NNN ABCXXXX The international country code prefix for Mexico is 52 When dialing a number it must be formatted as plus sign  country code  10digit number eg 52 NNN ABC XXXX Some Central American countries write the country code for their own and other Central American countries in parentheses instead of using a  sign as recommended by E123 For example for a number in Costa Rica they would write 506 22222222 instead of 506 22222222 On the other hand Guatemala does have the custom of using the  sign It is quite common for Central American businesses to write the whole phone number including the country code in parentheses on business cards signs stationery etc Costa Rican telephone numbers have eight digits and are usually written in the format 2NNNNNNN for landlines 8NNNNNNN for mobile telephone numbers from local telephone company ICE 6NNNNNNN for mobile telephone numbers from Movistar and 7NNNNNNN for mobile phone numbers from Claro19 Tollfree numbers use the format 800NNNNNNN and premiumrate telephone numbers are written 90xNNNNNNN where x varies according to the type of service offered There are also short numbers for emergencies such as 911 When Costa Rica switched from 7 to 8digit numbers it used a scheme similar to the 8digit number scheme already in place in El Salvador at that time El Salvadoran telephone numbers have eight digits usually written in the format 2NNNNNNN for landline use and 7NNNNNNN for mobile telephone numbers Premiumrate numbers start with a 9 Guatemalan telephone numbers have eight digits and written in the format 2NNNNNNN for landlines in Guatemala City 6NNNNNNN for landlines for the rest of municipalities in the Guatemala Department and 7NNNNNNN for landlines in Rural Guatemala  rest of country Nongeographic numbers mobile are 5NNNNNNN 4NNNNNNN and 3NNNNNNN Within each area there are different service providers The following 3 digits indicate the service provider However their assignment is on a firstcome firstserved basis Additionally there are special numbers with the following conventions 3 digit numbers for emergency systems four digit numbers 15NN for information and governmental institutions and 17NN for commercial and banking institutions with a high call influx 6 digit numbers for Telephone carriers numbers and making operator assisted calls collect calls These calls are billed at different rates 1800 Tollfree calls redirected to out of country offices and 1801 Local tollfree calls20 Honduran telephone numbers have either seven digits for landlines which are usually written NNNNNNN or eight digits for mobile numbers which are written NNNNNNNN The fact that landline and mobile numbers are different lengths sometimes causes confusion In 2010 an additional digit 2 was added to the start of land line numbers thus standardizing the length at eight digits Argentine telephone numbers always consist of 11 digits including the geographical area code The area code can have 3 4 or 5 digits the first being always 0 indicative of longdistance calls Moreover in 1999 the whole country except Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires was divided into two zones Roughly and with exceptions one includes most of the northern half of the country and the other most of the southern half though the actual reason for this division is not geographical but the fact that each zone is administered by a different company So the second digit of area codes can be 1 only in Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires code 011 or else a 2 for towns in the southern half of the country or a 3 for the northern half For example 011 for Buenos Aires 0341 for Rosario 02627 for San Rafael And the subscribers number will accordingly have 6 7 or 8 digits to complete the eleven digits Phone numbers are mostly written as 011 xxxxxxxx Note that only the 011 code has 3 digits 0xxx xxxxxxx or 0xxxx xxxxxx The area code is usually written between brackets In 1999 a general reform was introduced to telephone numbers including the 1 2 and 3 for area codes as explained above and adding a 4 at the beginning of all subscribers numbers However since the reform some local numbers starting with a 5 are beginning to appear Moreover a hyphen is usually placed to separate the last four digits Code areas do not usually include one single city or town but several neighbouring towns So the part before the hyphen called a prefix is usually indicative of either a town within the code area or even of a part of a larger city which is assigned several prefixes As a matter of fact each area code has only a limited number of prefixes assigned and these are locally limited within the area For example the 0342 area has numbers with a 456 prefix mostly located in the centre of Santa Fe It also has numbers with a 460 prefix usually for phone lines in the north east of the city And there are lines with a 474 prefix located in Santo Tom But no 444 prefix exists within this area As for the part after the hyphen it may usually be any succession of four digits though sometimes a prefix is shared by two or more small towns and then the first digit after the hyphen carries the distinction between towns Sometimes a prefix is reserved for official numbers that is for offices depending on the national provincial or local state In the 0342 area this is 457 and phones within this prefix communicate with each other by simply dialing the four final digits though from other phones the prefix must be dialled as well Mobile phones use the same area codes as landline telephones but the number begins with a 15 added to a string of 6 7 or 8 digits just as described above After the 15 the remainder of the number can start with a 3 a 4 a 5 or a 6 This 15 may be dropped when a call is made to a mobile phone in a different code area And when sending text messages the receivers number is best dialled both without the 15 and with the longdistance code even if both sender and receiver share a code area but without the initial 0 To sum up given the mobile phone 011 1541234567 you will call it by dialing 1541234567 within the same code area 011 1541234567 from a different code area including or omitting the 15 And you will send messages to 11 41234567 even when your phone has also a 011 number Two sorts of special numbers exist in Argentina On the one hand threedigit numbers are used for special services such as to call the police fire brigade or emergency doctors as well as to hear the official time Also telephone companies have threedigit numbers to report a problem in the lines or to ask for another subscribers number when a paper directory is not available Additionally there are other longer numbers These include but are not limited to 0800 xxx abcd 0810 xxx abcd 0600 xxx abcd where the xxx indicates the same digit dialled three times and a b c and d may each be any of the ten digits 0800 lines are used by companies and it is the receiver and not the caller who pays for the call so that potential clients are encouraged to contact business companies for free 0810 lines are paid by the caller but the cost is for a local call even if you are calling from a different area The remaining is covered by the receiver And 0600 numbers are special more expensive lines that serve such purposes as TV games fund collecting for charity companies hot lines etc Basically a part of the extra money charged to the caller is sent to the owner of the line Often the abcd or even xxxabcd part of the number is chosen if available to form a word that is representative of the company holding the number Brazil is divided into 67 twodigit geographical area codes all of which with eightdigit numbers in the format AA NNNNNNNN except for cell phones which contain nine digits usually in the format AA 9NNNNNNNN Peru uses 2digit area codes followed by 6digit subscriber numbers outside of Lima In Lima the area code is 1 and the subscriber number has seven digits divided XXX XXXX The trunk 0 is often used especially for numbers outside Lima For example a phone number in Arequipa might be written 054 XXXXXX Cellphone numbers used to have eight digits with the first digit always being 9 In 2008 an additional digit was added to cellphone numbers while land numbers remained the same The previous convention for cell numbers in Lima was usually 9XXX XXXX though 9XXX XXXX was also used With the new 9digit number the form 9XX XXX XXX is becoming increasingly common as opposed to 9 XXXX XXXX 9X XXX XXXX or 9XXXX XXXX Outside Lima cellphone numbers used to be 9 followed by six digits ie 9 XXX XXX The 2008 changes were somewhat more complicated In four departments similar to states a 2 digit code now has to be entered before the 9 In the example of Arequipa the code of 95 has to be entered before the 9 so the new numeration is 959 XXX XXX The other codes are 94 for La Libertad Trujillo 96 for Piura and 97 for Lambayeque Chiclayo In the other 19 rural departments the 9 is followed by the departments 2digit area code then the 6digit subscriber number For example the area code for Cusco is 84 so their new cellphone numeration is 984 XXX XXX The effect is that all Peruvian cellphone numbers now have nine digits under the old system they had eight digits in Lima and 7 everywhere else21 Long distance calling Short code  Karachi and Lahore now have eight digit phone numbers In the near future this will be extended to other metros  Daily Times Pakistan 20090708 Retrieved 20091001  Philippines Landline Telephone Numbering Plan since 6 October 2019

Natural language processing   news   news   books   scholar   JSTOR  May 2024 Learn how and when to remove this message Natural language processing NLP is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics Typically data is collected in text corpora using either rulebased statistical or neuralbased approaches in machine learning and deep learning Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s1 Already in 1950 Alan Turing published an article titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language The premise of symbolic NLP is wellsummarized by John Searles Chinese room experiment Given a collection of rules eg a Chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other NLP tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English The authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem2 However real progress was much slower and after the ALPAC report in 1966 which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America though some research continued elsewhere such as Japan and Europe3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and ELIZA a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 Using almost no information about human thought or emotion ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly humanlike interaction When the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base ELIZA might provide a generic response for example responding to My head hurts with Why do you say your head hurts Ross Quillians successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time4 1970s During the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured realworld information into computerunderstandable data Examples are MARGIE Schank 1975 SAM Cullingford 1978 PAM Wilensky 1978 TaleSpin Meehan 1976 QUALM Lehnert 1977 Politics Carbonell 1979 and Plot Units Lehnert 1981 During this time the first chatterbots were written eg PARRY 1980s The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP Focus areas of the time included research on rulebased parsing eg the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology eg twolevel morphology5 semantics eg Lesk algorithm reference eg within Centering Theory6 and other areas of natural language understanding eg in the Rhetorical Structure Theory Other lines of research were continued eg the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky An important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period7 Up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules Starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing This was due to both the steady increase in computational power see Moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing8 1990s Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at IBM Research such as IBM alignment models These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government However most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems As a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s With the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data have become available since the mid1990s Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semisupervised learning algorithms Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been handannotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and nonannotated data Generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data However there is an enormous amount of nonannotated data available including among other things the entire content of the World Wide Web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical In 2003 word ngram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was outperformed by a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling by Yoshua Bengio with coauthors9 In 2010 Tom Mikolov then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology with coauthors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling10 and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec In the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques1112 can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling13 and parsing1415 This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care16 or protect patient privacy17 Symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular1819 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming Machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rulebased approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar eg containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input eg with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rulebased systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rulebased systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems Although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023 Before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods eg for the machine translation of lowresource languages such as provided by the Apertium system for preprocessing in NLP pipelines eg tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines eg for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses In the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches2021 The earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches Only the introduction of hidden Markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering Since 201522 the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks23 and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words Intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore Neural machine translation based on thennewlyinvented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing Some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks Though natural language processing tasks are

representation learning and endtoend systems Most higherlevel NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language More broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above Cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses47 Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes48 Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics49 Especially during the age of symbolic NLP the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies As an example George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing NLP algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics50 with two defining aspects Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by Lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author51 For example consider the English word big When used in a comparison That is a big tree the authors intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience When used metaphorically Tomorrow is a big day the authors intent to imply importance The intent behind other usages like in She is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information Assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed eg by means of a probabilistic contextfree grammar PCFG The mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in US Patent 9269353  Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s Nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar53 functional grammar54 construction grammar55 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg ACTR however with limited uptake in mainstream NLP as measured by presence on major conferences56 of the ACL More recently ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability eg under the notion of cognitive AI57 Likewise ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP although rarely made explicit58 and developments in artificial intelligence specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches59 and new directions in artificial

cases that stress the limits of its theoretical models comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics typically created using thought experiments rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in realworld data as is the case in corpus linguistics The creation and use of such corpora of realworld data is a fundamental part of machinelearning algorithms for natural language processing In addition theoretical underpinnings of Chomskyan linguistics such as the socalled poverty of the stimulus argument entail that general learning algorithms as are typically used in machine learning cannot be successful in language processing As a result the Chomskyan paradigm discouraged the application of such models to language processing  Bengio Yoshua

language as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions In general computational linguistics draws upon linguistics computer science artificial intelligence mathematics logic philosophy cognitive science cognitive psychology psycholinguistics anthropology and neuroscience among others The field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the United States in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages particularly Russian scientific journals into English1 Since rulebased approaches were able to make arithmetic systematic calculations much faster and more accurately than humans it was expected that lexicon morphology syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules as well After the failure of rulebased approaches David Hays2 coined the term in order to distinguish the field from AI and cofounded both the Association for Computational Linguistics ACL and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics ICCL in the 1970s and 1980s What started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing34 In order to be able to meticulously study the English language an annotated text corpus was much needed The Penn Treebank5 was one of the most used corpora It consisted of IBM computer manuals transcribed telephone conversations and other texts together containing over 45 million words of American English annotated using both partofspeech tagging and syntactic bracketing6 Japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of lognormality was found in relation to sentence length7 The fact that during language acquisition children are largely only exposed to positive evidence8 meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided and no evidence for what is not correct9 was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s10 It has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span11 which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children11 Robots have been used to test linguistic theories12 Enabled to learn as children might models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions perceptions and effects were created and linked to spoken words Crucially these robots were able to acquire functioning wordtomeaning mappings without needing grammatical structure Using the Price equation and Plya urn dynamics researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modernday languages13 Chomskys theories have influenced computational linguistics particularly in understanding how infants learn complex grammatical structures such as those described in Chomsky normal form14 Attempts have been made to determine how an infant learns a nonnormal grammar as theorized by Chomsky normal form9 Research in this area combines structural approaches with computational models to analyze large linguistic corpora like the Penn Treebank helping to uncover patterns in language acquisition15 Philosophy portal Artificial intelligence in

Timeline Progress AI winter AI boom Glossary Glossary Glossary vte v t e Machine learning ML is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions1 Quick progress in the field of deep learning beginning in 2010s allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance2 ML finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine34 The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics Statistics and mathematical optimization mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning Data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis EDA via unsupervised learning67 From a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct PAC learning provides a framework for describing machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence89 The synonym selfteaching computers was also used in this time period1011 Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes12 In 1949 Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells13 Hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data12 Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes12 By the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called Cybertron had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning It was repetitively trained by a human operatorteacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions14 A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilssons book on Learning Machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification15 Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by Duda and Hart in 197316 In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal17 Tom M Mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T as measured by P improves with experience E18 This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms This follows Alan Turings proposal in his paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which the question Can machines think is replaced with the question Can machines do what we as thinking entities can do19 Modernday machine learning has two objectives One is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions20 As a scientific endeavor machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence AI In the early days of AI as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics22 Probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis23 488 However an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation23 488 By 1980 expert systems had come to dominate AI and statistics was out of favor24 Work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within AI leading to inductive logic programmingILP but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval23 708710 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time This line too was continued outside the AICS field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield Rumelhart and Hinton Their main success came in the mid1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation23 25 Machine learning ML reorganized and recognized as its own field started to flourish in the 1990s The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory24 There is a close connection between machine learning and compression A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution Conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence252627 An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors and compressionbased similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces For each compressor C we define an associated vector space  such that C maps an input string x corresponding to the vector norm x An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space instead feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods LZW LZ77 and PPM28 According to AIXI theory a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x For example in that model a zip files compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software since you can not unzip it without both but there may be an even smaller combined form Examples of AIpowered audiovideo compression software include NVIDIA Maxine AIVC29 Examples of software that can perform AIpowered image compression include OpenCV TensorFlow MATLABs Image Processing Toolbox IPT and HighFidelity Generative Image Compression30 In unsupervised machine learning kmeans clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression31 Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission Kmeans clustering an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters k each represented by the centroid of its points This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing kmeans clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space32 Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases Data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy Much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ECML PKDD being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining KDD the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge Evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical KDD task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples34 Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns35 According to Michael I Jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics36 He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field36 Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set In addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis In contrast machine learning is not built on a prestructured model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns The more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be37 Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model38 wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning39 Analytical and computational techniques derived from deeprooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to largescale problems including machine learning eg to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks40 Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics41 A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience542 Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the Probably Approximately Correct Learning PAC model Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms Instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common The biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error For the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data If the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data If the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases But if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer43 In addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning In computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time There are two kinds of time complexity results Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system Supervised learning The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs Unsupervised learning No labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning Reinforcement learning A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent As it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback thats analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize5 Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems444546 Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs47 The data known as training data consists of a set of training examples Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal In the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix Through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs48 An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task18 Types of supervisedlearning algorithms include active learning classification and regression49 Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range As an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person or the future temperature 50 Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are It has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled classified or categorized Instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction7 and density estimation51 Unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pangenome52 Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity A special type of unsupervised learning called selfsupervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself5455 Semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data Some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy In weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets56 Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward Due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulationbased optimization multiagent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms In reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process MDP Many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques57 Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables58 In other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis PCA PCA involves changing higherdimensional data eg 3D to a smaller space eg 2D The manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this threefold categorization and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system For example topic modeling metalearning59 Selflearning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array CAA60 It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice The CAA selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion61 The selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix W was such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s compute emotion of being in the consequence situation vs update crossbar memory was  was  vs It is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment The backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation The CAA exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment After receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the CAA learns a goalseeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations62 Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training63 Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis Feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised In supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data Examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning In unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data Examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization64 and various forms of clustering656667 Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors68 Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data69 Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process However realworld data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix The method is strongly NPhard and difficult to solve approximately70 A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the kSVD algorithm Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts In classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs For a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot71 In data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data72 Typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text Anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions73 In particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object Many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately Instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the microclusters formed by these patterns74 Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist75 Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection Semisupervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning7677 and finally metalearning eg MAML Association rule learning is a rulebased machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness78 Rulebased machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge The defining characteristic of a rulebased machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction79 Rulebased machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems Based on the concept of strong rules Rakesh Agrawal Tomasz Imieliski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in largescale transaction data recorded by pointofsale POS systems in supermarkets80 For example the rule  o n i o n s  p o t a t o e s    b u r g e r  displaystyle mathrm onionspotatoes Rightarrow mathrm burger  found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements In addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics In contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions Learning classifier systems LCS are a family of rulebased machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning They seek to identify a set of contextdependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions81 Inductive logic programming ILP is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting828384 Shapiro built their first implementation Model Inference System in 1981 a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples85 The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a wellordered set A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that after being trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data During training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the models internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions86 By extension the term model can refer to several levels of specificity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned87 Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection Artificial neural networks ANNs or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains Such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain Each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it In common ANN implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs The connections between artificial neurons are called edges Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold Typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs Signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would However over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition88 Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees In decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making In data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decisionmaking Supportvector machines SVMs also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression Given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category89 An SVM training algorithm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting In addition to performing linear classification SVMs can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features Its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression When dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel90 logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space A Bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph DAG For example a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms Given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic Bayesian networks Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a predefined covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations Given a set of observed points or inputoutput examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization A genetic algorithm GA is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem In machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s9293 Conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms94 The theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or DempsterShafer theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability possibility and imprecise probability theories These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined eg Dempsters rule of combination just like how in a pmfbased Bayesian approachclarification needed would combine probabilities However there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learners decision boundary low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving49 However the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches Typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions When training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model Trained models derived from biased or nonevaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices For example Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google95 There are many applications for machine learning including Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decisionmaking Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brainmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Creditcard fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis96

analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Timeseries forecasting Tomographic reconstruction97 User behavior analytics In 2006 the mediaservices provider Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10 A joint team made up of researchers from ATT LabsResearch in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for 1 million98 Shortly after the prize was awarded Netflix realized that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly99 In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis100 In 2012 cofounder of Sun Microsystems Vinod Khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software101 In 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists102 In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning103 In 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID19104 Machine learning was recently applied to predict the proenvironmental behavior of travelers105 Recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphones performance and thermal behavior based on the users interaction with the phone106107108 When applied correctly machine learning algorithms MLAs can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS109 Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes110 Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes111112113 Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires114115 Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machinelearning programs often fail to deliver expected results116117118 Reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems119 The black box theory poses another yet significant challenge Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data120 The House of Lords Select Committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individuals life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes120 In 2018 a selfdriving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision121 Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested122123 Microsofts Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users124 Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature While it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves125 Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data When trained on humanmade data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society126 Language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases127128 In an experiment carried out by ProPublica an investigative journalism organization a machine learning algorithms insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants129 In 2015 Google Photos would often tag black people as gorillas129 and in 2018 this still was not well resolved but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all130 Similar issues with recognizing nonwhite people have been found in many other systems131 In 2016 Microsoft tested Tay a chatbot that learned from Twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language132 Because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains133 Concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including FeiFei Li who reminds engineers that theres nothing artificial about AI Its inspired by people its created by people andmost importantlyit impacts people It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility134 Explainable AI XAI or Interpretable AI or Explainable Machine Learning XML is artificial intelligence AI in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI135 It contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision136 By refining the mental models of users of AIpowered systems and dismantling their misconceptions XAI promises to help users perform more effectively XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation Settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is137 Learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses138 A realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies139140 Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations For some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel141 Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation andor evasion via adversarial machine learning142 Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying eg for categories spam and wellvisible not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed andor trained by third parties Parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided possibly including whitebox access143144145 Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set In comparison the Kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K1 subsets for training the model In addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy146 In addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate TPR and True Negative Rate TNR respectively Similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate FPR as well as the false negative rate FNR However these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators The total operating characteristic TOC is an effective method to express a models diagnostic ability TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic ROC and ROCs associated area under the curve AUC147 Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices148 For example in 1988 the UKs Commission for Racial Equality found that St Georges Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have nonEuropean sounding names126 Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants149150 Another example includes predictive policing company Geoliticas predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of overpolicing in lowincome and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data129 While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learnings vulnerability to biases151 In fact according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association CRA in 2021 female faculty merely make up 161 of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world152 Furthermore among the group of new US resident AI PhD graduates 45 identified as white 224 as Asian 32 as Hispanic and 24 as African American which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI152 AI can be wellequipped to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning153 Because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases154155 Other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines156 This is especially true in the United States where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits For example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated157 Since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units158 By 2019 graphic processing units GPUs often with AIspecific enhancements had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud AI159 OpenAI estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet 2012 to AlphaZero 2017 and found a 300000fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of 34 months160161 A physical neural network or Neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse Physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to softwarebased approaches More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse162163 Embedded Machine Learning is a subfield of machine learning where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers164165166 Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration167168 using approximate computing169 optimization of machine learning models and many more170171 Pruning Quantization Knowledge Distillation LowRank Factorization Network Architecture Search NAS  Parameter

The definition without being explicitly programmed is often attributed to Arthur Samuel who coined the term machine learning in 1959 but the phrase is not found verbatim in this publication and may be

transmission system many sources to many receivers while traditional media operate under a monologic  transmission model one source to many receivers For instance a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city11 Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers including exposure to inappropriate content exploitation by adults sleep problems attention problems feelings of exclusion and various mental health maladies1213 Social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy The PLATO system was launched in 1960 at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes PLATOs messageforum application TERMtalk its instantmessaging feature Talkomatic perhaps the first online chat room News Report a crowdsourced online newspaper and blog and Access Lists enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users for example only friends classmates or coworkers ARPANET which came online in 1967 had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of nongovernmentbusiness ideas and communication as evidenced by the network etiquette or netiquette described in a 1982 handbook on computing at MITs Artificial Intelligence Laboratory14 ARPANET evolved into the Internet in the 1990s15 Usenet conceived by Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University was the first open social media app established in 1980 A precursor of the electronic bulletin board system BBS known as Community Memory appeared by 1973 Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago which launched on February 16 1978 Before long most major US cities had more than one BBS running on TRS80 Apple II Atari 8bit computers IBM PC Commodore 64 Sinclair and others CompuServe Prodigy and AOL were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s Between the mid1980s and the mid1990s BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone16 Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s In 1991 Tim BernersLee integrated HTML hypertext software with the Internet creating the World Wide Web This breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs list servers and email services Message forums migrated to the web and evolved into Internet forums supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously These early textbased systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century aided by digital cameras and camera phones17 The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of Web 206 Social media started in the mid1990s with the invention of platforms like GeoCities Classmatescom and SixDegreescom18 While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously It boasted features like profiles friends lists and school affiliations making it the very first social networking site1819 The platforms name was inspired by the six degrees of separation concept which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else20 In the early 2000s social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of Friendster and Myspace followed by Facebook YouTube and Twitter21 Research from 2015 reported that globally users spent 22 of their online time on social networks22 likely fueled by the availability of smartphones23 As of 2023 as many as 476 billion

than one type of service5 Mobile social media refers to the use of social media on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets It is distinguished by its ubiquity since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer Mobile services can further make use of the users immediate location to offer information connections or services relevant to that location According to Andreas Kaplan mobile social media activities fall among four types27 Spacetimers location and timesensitive Exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time posting about a traffic jam Spacelocators only location sensitive Postsmessages with relevance for a specific location read later by others eg a restaurant review Quicktimers only time sensitive Transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy eg posting status updates Slowtimers neither location nor time sensitive Transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices eg watching a video Certain content has the potential to spread virally an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual One user spreads a post across their network which leads those users to follow suit A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours Virality is not guaranteed few posts make the transition Viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns Nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content such as Xs and Facebooks like option28 Bots are automated programs that operate on the internet29 They automate many communication tasks This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers30 Chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking commenting and following31 Bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing32 Bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions33 Some bots violate platforms terms of use which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically34 Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions35 Cyborgseither botassisted humans or humanassisted bots35are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz363738 A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time39 A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time In other cases cyborgs spread fake news35 Cyborgs may work as sock puppets where one human pretends to be someone else or operates multiple accounts each pretending to be a person A multitude of United States patents are

relationships and a sense of loneliness179 A 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media It concluded that blue light from computerphone displaysand the frequency rather than the duration of time spent predicted disturbed sleep termed obsessive checking183 The association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults184 A recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance The median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61 Females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance185 Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones and this left them tired and unfocused in school186 A 2011 study reported that time spent on Facebook was negatively associated with GPA but the association with sleep disturbance was not established187 One studied effect of social media is Facebook depression which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media8 This may lead to reclusiveness which can increase loneliness and low selfesteem8 Social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling184 Studies report childrens selfesteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments This affected selfperception188 A 2017 study of almost 6000 adolescent students reported that those who selfreported addictionlike symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low selfesteem and high levels of depressive symptoms189 A second emotional effect is social media burnout defined as ambivalence emotional exhaustion and depersonalization Ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media Emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media Depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media The three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media190 A third emotional effect is fear of missing out FOMO which is the pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent191 It is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media191 Social media can also offer support as Twitter has done for the medical community192 X facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes comments and posts193 Access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones194 Some commentators refer to social media as antisocial media when describing its social impact195196 The digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology including smartphones tablets laptops and the internet197198 The digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources In the Information Age people without access to the Internet and other technology are at a disadvantage for they are unable or less able to connect with others find and apply for jobs shop and learn197199 Many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content204205 Because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure Political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them206 Aviv Ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content207 but could be designed to reduce polarization instead208 In 2017 Facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity misinformation and lowquality news209 Some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts210211207 Some advocate for media literacy as a solution212 Others argue that less social media206 or more local journalism213214215 could help address political polarization A 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes216 Stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations For example during the COVID19 pandemic youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease217 Elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media218 Social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication despite different ways of communicating in various cultures219 Social media has affected the way youth communicate by introducing new forms of language220 Novel acronyms save time as illustrated by LOL which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud The hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others Hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion221 For some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills222 What is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media223 The American Academy of Pediatrics reported that bullying the making of noninclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages Sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk224225226227 However adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online228 Social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities8 This section needs expansion You can help by adding to it  July 2024 In July 2014 in response to WikiLeaks release of a secret suppression order made by the Victorian Supreme Court media lawyers were quoted in the Australian media to the effect that anyone who tweets a link to the WikiLeaks report posts it on Facebook or shares it in any way online could also face charges229 On 27 July 2020 in Egypt two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting TikTok videos which the government claimed as violating family values230 In the 2014 Thai coup dtat the public was explicitly instructed not to share or like dissenting views on social media or face prisoncitation needed Historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented They set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore The US enacted the Communications Decency Act in 1996 Section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 47 USC  230c1 In 2024 legislation was enacted in Florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14 and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval231232 The European Union initially took a similar approach233 However in 2020 the European Commission presented two legislative proposals The Digital Services Act DSA and the Digital Markets Act DMA Both proposals were enacted in July 2022 The DSA entered into force on 17 February 2024 the DMA in March 2024234 This legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by MEPs What is illegal offline must also be illegal online235 Very large online platforms must therefore among other things delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the European Commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 Violators could face a complete ban in Europe or fines of up to 6 of global sales Such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers237 Enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance238 The DSA allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction According to Patrick Breyer from the German Pirate Party a problem could arise from the Hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of Victor Orban as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied EUwide239 2018 Nobel Laureate Paul Romer240 advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms237 Similar to a carbon tax  negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms241 Assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them However consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax  Another proposal is to invoke competition law242 The idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law This would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines In a 2024 opinion piece Megan Moreno and Jenny Radesky professors of pediatrics wrote about the need for nuanced policy243 They regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful They commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages244 In June 2024 US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people245 The business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers Platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them This strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see Platforms such as X add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues246 The enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy Criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability247 impact on concentration mental health248 content ownership and the meaning of interactions and poor crossplatform interoperability249 decrease in facetoface interactions cyberbullying sexual predation particularly of children and child pornography250251 In 2007 Andrew Keen wrote Out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated Under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering252 Social media has become a regular source of news and information A 2021 Pew Research Center poll reported roughly 70 of users regularly get news from social media4 despite the presence of fake news and misinformation Platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy and many do not vet content at all although in some cases content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced253254255 Content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance responding instead to the contents virality In 2018 researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70 faster than truthful news on X7 Social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users10 Some platforms attempt to discover and block bots with limited success11 Fake news seems to receive more user engagement possibly because it is relatively novel engaging users curiosity and increasing spread23 Fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event before conventional media are prepared to publish2016 Social media mining is the process of obtaining data from usergenerated content on social media in order to extract actionable patterns form conclusions about users and act upon the information Mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research The term is an analogy to the process of mining for minerals Mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals likewise social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage online behaviour content sharing connections between individuals buying behaviour These patterns and trends are of interest to companies governments and notforprofit organizations as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies introduce programs products processes or services Social media mining uses concepts from computer science data mining machine learning and statistics Mining is based on social network analysis network science sociology ethnography optimization and mathematics It attempts to formally represent measure and model patterns from social media data256 In the 2010s major corporations governments and notforprofit organizations began mining to learn about customers clients and others Platforms such as Google Facebook partnered with Datalogix and BlueKai conduct mining to target users with advertising257 Scientists and machine learning researchers extract insights and design product features258 Users may not understand how platforms use their data259 Users tend to click through Terms of Use agreements without reading them leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users privacy Malcolm Gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated He concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves that expression likely has no impact beyond social media What he called highrisk activism involves strong relationships coordination commitment high risks and sacrifice261 Gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that social networks are effective at increasing participationby lessening the level of motivation that participation requires261 According to him Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice261 Disputing Gladwells theory a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity262 Social media content is generated by users However content ownership is defined by the Terms of Service to which users agree Platforms control access to the content and may make it available to third parties263 Although platforms terms differ generally they all give permission to utilize users copyrighted works at the platforms discretion264 After its acquisition by Facebook in 2012 Instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users265266 It then reversed these changes with thenCEO Kevin Systrom promising to update the terms of service267268 Privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data Information is captured without the users knowing consent Data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes269263 Information may be offered for third party use Young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators270 While social media users claim to want to keep their data private their behavior does not reflect that concern as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles In addition platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles This data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising271 A 2014 Pew Research Center survey reported that 91 of Americans agree or strongly agree that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used Some 80 of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms and 64 said the government should do more to regulate advertisers272 In 2019 UK legislators criticized Facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data273 In 2019 the Pentagon issued guidance to the military Coast Guard and other government agencies that identified the potential risk associated with using the TikTok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information274 As a result the military Coast Guard Transportation Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security banned the installation and use of TikTok on government devices275 In 2020 The US government attempted to ban TikTok and WeChat from the States over national security concerns However a federal court blocked the move276 In 2024 the US Congress passed a low directing TikToks parent company ByteDance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the US The company sued challenging the constitutionality of the ban277 Internet addiction disorder IAD also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use is a problematic compulsive use of the internet particularly on social media that impairs an individuals function over a prolonged period of time Young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder278 with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online279 Some experience health consequences from loss of sleep280 as they stay up to continue scrolling chatting and gaming281 Excessive Internet use is not recognized as a disorder by the World Health Organization the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM5 or the International Classification of Diseases ICD11282 However gaming disorder appears in the ICD11283 Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders Definitions are not standardized or agreed upon complicating the development of evidencebased recommendations Users under 30 access the Internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse284 In 2011 the term Facebook addiction disorder FAD emerged285 FAD is characterized by compulsive use of Facebook A 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use and narcissism reporting FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables depression anxiety and stress symptoms286287 In 2020 the documentary The Social Dilemma reported concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social medias pursuit of addictive use For example when a user has not visited Facebook for some time the platform varies its notifications attempting to lure them back It also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality288 Whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous291 A study of Americans aged 1215 reported that teenagers who used social media over three hoursday doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety292 Platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content A 2023 study of Australian youth reported that 57 had seen disturbingly violent content while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images293 Further youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullyingcitation needed As result phones have been banned from some schools and some schools in the US have blocked social media websites294 Social media often features in political struggles In some countries Internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens use of social media For example in 2013 some social media was banned in Turkey after the Taksim Gezi Park protests Both X and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a courts decision A law granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate TB personnel The TB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order295 Yet TBs 2014 blocking of X was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech296 Internet censorship in the United States is the suppression of information published or viewed on the Internet in the United States The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal state and local government censorship Free speech protections allow little governmentmandated Internet content restrictions However the Internet is highly regulated supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms297 Gambling cyber security and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the US297 Many governmentmandated attempts to regulate content have been barred often after lengthy legal battles298 However the government has exerted pressure indirectly With the exception of child pornography content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to removesuppress content following state encouragement or the threat of legal action299297 While the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable open source protocols such as ActivityPub have been adopted by platforms such as Mastodon GNU social Diaspora and Friendica They operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteeroperated servers called the Fediverse However in 2019 Mastodon blocked Gab from connecting to it claiming that it spread violent rightwing extremism305 In December 2019 X CEO Jack Dorsey advocated an open and decentralized standard for social media He joined Bluesky to bring it to reality306 Deplatforming also called noplatforming is a form of Internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their informationideas This typically involves suspension outright bans or reducing spread shadow banning307308 A number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on311 Zack Beauchamp of Vox calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats312 The Economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats313 Informed dialogue a shared sense of reality mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media314 Political polarization can be one byproduct315316317 This has implications for the likelihood of political violence318206 Siva Vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing antitrust laws195 Andrew Leonard describes Polis as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus319320 According to LikeWar The Weaponization of Social Media321 the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities corporations and governments but also extremist groups322 The use of social media by ISIS and AlQaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers Social media platforms and encryptedmessaging applications have been used to recruit members both locally and internationally323 Platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content Extreme nationalist groups and more prominently US rightwing extremists have used similar online tactics As many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech several platforms became popular among rightwing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events these application became known as Alttech Platforms such as Telegram Parler and Gab were used during the January 6 United States Capitol attack to coordinate attacks324 Members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians325 Social media content persists unless the user deletes it After a user dies unless the platform is notified their content remains326 Each platform has created guidelines for this situation327 In most cases on social media the platforms require a nextofkin to prove that the user is deceased and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a legacy status X328 The company works with an immediate family member to deactivate the account Additionally X will not give the account to any other person regardless of the relationship Facebook Users have the option of having their account permanently deleted after death Users can identify a legacy contact who would take over the account after Instagram329 Users can have the account memorialized or deleted with proof of death LinkedIn330 A family member can request that the account be deleted The family member must identify the account submit proof of relationship the users email address date of death a link to the obituary and the name of the last company the deceased worked for Pinterest Must email the company with the URL of the account along with a death certificate or a link to the obituary as well as proof of relationship to the deceased YouTube331 A representative can close the account transfer payments from the account to an immediate family member and legal representative of the users estate and can provide the data in the account to a family member All three capabilities require the

excluding an initial zero which is required at times and fall in at least four distinct categories Landlines In China the length of phone numbers varies from city to city It is usually written as 0XXX YYY YYYY For landlines registered in large metropolises it is written in the format 0XXX YYYY YYYY where 0 is the trunk code XXX is the area code 2 or 3 digits and YYYY YYYY is the local number 7 or 8 digits For example 0755 XXXX YYYY indicates a Shenzhen number XXXXYYYY is dialed locally 0755 XXXX YYYY is dialed in other areas inside the country while for international calls to Shenzhen the 0 is dropped and is written 86 755 XXXX YYYY Mobiles The 11digit code is always written in full in the whole China eg 1WX YYYY ZZZZ Each WX is assigned to a service provider while W is usually 3 through 9

traditional convention for phone numbers is 0AA NXXXXXX where 0AA is the area code and NXXXXXX is the subscriber number This number format is very similar to the North American numbering plan but the country has a trunk code of 0 instead of 1 so international callers using 81 do not have to dial the trunk code 0 when calling to Japan Telephone numbers had nine digits in Tokyo and Osaka until the late 1990s when a seventh digit was added to the subscriber number Densely populated areas have shorter area codes while rural areas have longer area codes but the last two digits of a fivedigit area

of Okinawa where area codes increase from west to east or south to north Some telephone numbers deviate from this rule Tollfree dialing and Navi Dial operations 0120XXXXXX 0570XXXXXX or 0800XXXXXX where XXXXXX is the subscriber number The area code 050 uses an 11 digit phone number 050XXXXXXXX where XXXXXXXX is the subscriber number 110 and 119 are examples of three digit emergency numbers All area codes including mobile start with a 0 trunk prefix for domestic calls If you are dialing from another country the international calling code for Malaysia is 60 which may be confusing do not dial

towns have a six digit number Large cities have sevendigit numbers Azad Jammu and Kashmir has five digit numbers On 1 July 2009 telephone numbers in Karachi and Lahore were changed from seven digits to eight digits This was accomplished by adding the digit 9 to the beginning of any phone number that started with a 9 government and semigovernment connections and adding the digit 3 to any phone numbers that did not start with the number 91 It is common to write phone numbers as 0xx yyyyyyy where xx is the area code The 0 prefix is for trunk longdistance dialing from within the country International callers should dial 92 xx yyyyyyyy All mobile phone codes have four digits and start with 03xx All mobile numbers have seven digits and denote the mobile provider on a nationwide basis

code may have two digits for some cities such as Seoul and Gwacheon these two cities use the same area code and three digits for other cities such as Incheon Busan and most of the cities in Gyeonggido The middle threedigit part is extended to four digits in many areas due to the increased number of telephone users In the international context 82 0XXXXXXXXX is commonly used as well For international calls 0 in the area code is often omitted because it is not necessary to dial 0 from foreign countries Therefore it is better written as 820XXXXXXXXX or 820XXXXXXXXXX The plus  sign is often added to the country code eg 82 0XXXXXXXXX or 820XXXXXXXXXX For mobile numbers 016490641 so on As with the landline home numbers the mobile numbers middle threedigit part is extended to four digits eg 016490641 due to the increased number of mobile phone users If a number starts with 070 the number does not belong to any particular area and is a number given by an Internet telephone service In this case 070 is not usually put in the brackets neither   nor  In the business context the numbers in the format of 15XXXXXX and 16XXXXXX are business representative agency or customer services While the numbers starting with 080 eg 080XXXXXXX are also businessrelated numbers but are usually tollfree customer service centers Also in this case 15XX 16XX or 070 are not put in the brackets neither   nor  There are national telephone services which have phone numbers in the format of 1XX or 1XXX without any area code For example 114 is for telephone yellow page 119 is for fireemergency number 112 is for police station center 131 is for weather forecast information 1333 is for traffic information and so on The number 111 is for reporting spies especially from North Korea It used to be 113 so most of senior citizen still believe it is the number for reporting spies These numbers do not need any brackets If there are multiple numbers used for one personentity the symbol  is usually used to avoid repetitions For example if one company has three phone numbers0311111111 (031) 111-1112 and 0311111113then they are shortened as in 03111111113 If the numbers are not consecutive then the last digit is written together with commas For example if a company has three numbers0311111111 (031) 111-1115 (031) 111-1119 then they are shortened as in (031) 111-1111 5 9 Landline numbers in Taiwan are

by 0 plus one digit 0x xxxx xxxx example 06 9756 4509 Thais often confuse the current numbering system with the old provincial area code system which no longer exists as area codes were integrated into all phone numbers in 2005 Because of this unofficially people often write numbers as 0xx xxx xxx 053 810 595 Calling a Thai phone number from outside Thailand one drops the 0 and adds the 66 country code Example 66 5381 05955 Most Australian telephone numbers have ten digits and are generally written 0A BBBB BBBB or 04XX XXX XXX for mobile telephone numbers where 0A is the optional area code 2378 and BBBB BBBB is the subscriber number   When the number is to be seen by an international audience it is written 61 A BBBB BBBB or 61 4XX XXX XXX When written for a local audience the optional area code is omitted The area code is often written within parentheses 0A BBBB BBBB Mobile numbers should never have parentheses Tendigit nongeographic numbers beginning with 1 are written 1X0Y BBB BBB where X  8 for toll free numbers X  3 for fixedfee numbers and X  9 for premium services Sixdigit nongeographic numbers are written 13 BB BB or 13B BBB these are fixedfee numbers Sevendigit 180 BBBB numbers also exist Bs are sometimes written as letters Almost all New Zealand telephone numbers have seven digits with a singledigit access code and a singledigit area code for longdistance domestic calls Traditionally the number was given as 0A BBBBBBB with the two first digits the STD code often omitted for local calls The brackets and the dash are also often omitted Mobile numbers follow the same format but with the area code being two digits ie 02M BBBBBBB  Some mobile numbers are longer 02102BBBBBB 02108BBBBBB 02040BBBBBB 020 41BBBBBB and 028 25BBBBBB and some are shorter 0213BBBBB 0214BBBBB 0215BBBBB 0216BBBBB 0217BBBBB 0218BBBBB and 0219BBBBB There are also freephone numbers starting with 0800 or 0508 that are given in the format 0800AAAAAA It is not uncommon for the 0800 and 0508 to be enclosed in brackets although this is not strictly correct as the brackets denote optional parts of the number and the 0800 and 0508 is required6 Recently with 8 digit mobile numbers becoming more common the prefix4 digits4 digits format has been adopted for readability 022 1234 5678 For international use the prefix 64 is substituted for the leading zero giving 64ABBBBBBB for landlines and 64MMBBBBBBB for mobile numbers Belgian telephone numbers consist of three parts First 0 secondly the zone prefix A which has one or two digits for landlines and three digits for mobile phones and thirdly the subscribers number B Land lines always have nine digits They are prefixed by a zero followed by the zone prefix Depending on the length of the zone prefix the subscribers number consists of either 6 or 7 digits Hence land line numbers are written either 0AA BB BB BB or 0A BBB BB BB Mobile phone numbers always consist of ten digits The first digit of the zone prefix of a mobile number is always 4 Then follows 2 digits indicating to which Mobile Operators pool the number originally belonged when it was taken into usage The fourth digit represents a subgroup of this pool and has no additional meaning other than increasing the amount of possible numbers The subscribers number consists of six digits Hence mobile phone numbers are written 04AA BB BB BB Sometimes the last six digits are written in two groups of 3 digits to increase readability 04AA BBB BBB Numbers are sometimes written with a slash in between the zone prefix and the subscribers number This is the case for both land lines and mobile phone numbers Sometimes dots are written between the blocks of the subscribers number Examples 0AABB BB BB 0AABBBBBB for mobile numbers 04AABB BB BB 04AABBBBBB or 04AABBBBBB The international code prefix for Belgium is 32 When dialing a number with the prefix the 0 can be dropped eg 32 9055 Danish telephone numbers have eight digits and are normally written in four groups of two digits each with the groups separated by spaces AA AA AA AA in two groups of four digits each with the groups separated by a space AAAA AAAA in one group of two digits followed by two groups of three digits each with the groups separated by spaces AA AAA AAA or all in one go AAAAAAAA The third option AA AAA AAA is not commonly used for personal landline or mobile numbers but is mostly found in corporate numbers especially in advertizing The standard formats  which when spoken divide numbers into ranges from 00 zero zero to 99 ninetynine  limit the possible range of the ability to create telephone numbers that are easy to remember dividing the numbers into groups of three expands the mnemonic possibilities Danish emergency and service numbers have three digits and are written AAA Danish short numbers used for text messaging services have four digits and are written AAAA French telephone numbers have ten digits usually written in groups of two separated by spaces in the format 0A BB BB BB BB where 0 the trunk prefix was created in 1996 to be a carrier selection code and A is the territorial area code included in the

have seven digits Phone numbers in Iceland have seven digits and generally written in the form XXX XXXX or XXXXXXX Phone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan with varying number lengths The area code system is similar to that in some other northern European countries Unlike the UK Irish fixed line numbering is divided into a number of regions which are except Dublin further subdivided in a hierarchical structure with the largest town often but not always taking 0A1 Area codes start with a trunk prefix 0 and extend for up to four digits but usually 3 followed by the local phone number of up to seven digits In industry jargon these area codes and prefixes are referred to as NDCs National Dialing Codes This is the term used by ComReg and technical documents as they include nongeographic codes Historically like the UK the term STD code Subscriber Trunk Dialling was used However the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion Dublin uses the shorter 01 code which is not further subdivided Other cities and major towns usually have codes ending in 1 Cork for example is 021 Galway 091 Limerick 061 etc The leading zero is always omitted when dialling from outside the country Local phone numbers have either 5 6 or 7digits In 7digit numbering they are usually grouped as BBB BBBB 6digit numbers are grouped BBB BBB and 5digit numbers are normally all grouped together BBBBB Grouping of numbers is not strictly adhered to but usually fairly consistent The area code should always be kept separated with a space or surrounded by brackets and not merged into the local number The use of hyphens is discouraged particularly on websites as it can prevent mobile browsers identifying the number as a clickable link for easier dialling Fixed line numbers are normally presented as follows 01 BBB BBBB for a Dublin number 7 digit 021 BBB BBBB for a Cork number 7 digit 064 BBB BBBB for a Killarney number 7 digit 061 BBB BBB for a Limerick number 6 digit 098 BBBBB for a Westport number 5 digit 0404 BBBBB for a Wicklow number 5 digit Area codes may also be surrounded by brackets but this practice is falling out of use as local dialing without the area code is optional on landlines and the area code must always be dialled on mobile phones The Irish telecommunication regulator ComReg has been gradually rationalising area codes by merging and extending local numbering to 7digits in the format 0AA BBB BBBB This is being carried out only where necessary to avoid disruption This means that varying fixed line number lengths will continue to exist in Ireland for the foreseeable future Mobile numbers are presented as follows 08A BBB BBBB Brackets should not be used around the mobile prefix as it is never optional and must always be dialled even from another phone with the same prefix Special rate numbers such as free phonetoll free and premium rate are usually grouped Freephone 1800 BB BB BB or spoken as oneeighthundred Local rate 1850 BB BB BB eighteenfifty 1550 BB BB BB read as fifteenfifty However for memorability this is not consistently adhered to Alphanumeric characters can also be used in presenting numbers for added memorability but it is much less common than in North America For example 18AA 99 TAXI Note These special rate numbers are not reachable from outside Ireland7 Phone numbers in Italy have variable length Theres no well established convention about how to group digits or which symbol to use but this is hardly an issue since all the digits are always dialed Since 10 October 1995 Operation Decibel all telephone numbers in the Netherlands have ten digits including the trunk prefix 0 The area code A is commonly separated with a dash  and sometimes a space from the subscribers number B Alternatively the area code including the trunk prefix can be enclosed in parentheses The length of the area code for landlines is either 2 or 3 digits depending on the population density of the area This leaves 7 or 6 digits for the subscribers number resulting in a format of either 0AABBBBBBB or 0AAABBBBBB Cellphone numbers are assigned the 1digit area code 6 leaving eight digits for the subscribers number 06CBBBBBBB where subscribers number C is neither 6 nor 7 Service numbers area codes 800 900 906 and 909 have either 4 or 7 remaining digits making them 8 or 11 digits in total 0AAABBBB or 0AAABBBBBBB The area code 14 has no trunk prefix and is used for government numbers currently only for municipalities The remaining digits represent the area code of the municipality Therefore the length 14 numbers total either 5 or 6 digits 14 0AA or 14 0AAA The trunk prefix 0 is dropped when prefixed by the country code 31 AA BBBBBBBB 31 6 CBBBBBBB etcetera Note that there is not a trunk prefix for the 14 series so the international number becomes 31 14 0AAA Norwegian telephone numbers have eight digits A number to a fixed line is written in four groups of two separated by spaces AA AA AA AA Phone numbers in the 8xx series are written in three groups AAA AA AAA This makes it easy to determine if the Bnumber is SMS capable Mobile numbers start with 4 or 9 Telephone numbers in Poland have nine digits For mobile phones the preferred format is AAAAAAAAA For landline phones the preferred format is AABBBBBBB where AA is area code Occasionally you can encounter numbers formatted as AA BBBBBBB Omitting area code is not permitted because nowadays it is always required Telephone numbers in Portugal have nine digits A number to a fixed line is written in three groups of two separated by spaces AAA AAA AAA Cellphone numbers are written in three groups AAA AAA AAA Mobile numbers start with 9 Starting with 2002 phone numbers in Romania have ten digits the first digit always being 0 The preferred format is AAAAAAAAAA for mobile except for landline phones in Bucharest where the preferred format is AAAAAAAAAA Russia has an open numbering plan with 10digit phone numbers Trunk prefix is 8 or 8CC when using alternative operators where CC is 2123 5255 International call prefix is 810 or 8CC when using alternative operators where CC is 2629 5659 The country code is 7 Length of geographical area codes A is usually 3 to 5 digits length of nongeographical area codes is 3 The groups of digits in the local subscribers number B are separated by dashes  BBBBBBB BBBBBB BBBBB The area code is included in parentheses similarly to E123 local notation AAA BBBBBBB AAAA BBBBBB AAAAA BBBBB Area code dialing is optional in most geographical area codes except Moscow area codes 495 498 499 it is mandatory for nongeographical area codes E123 international and Microsoft formats are used for writing local phone numbers as well international prefix and country code 7 are replaced with trunk code 8 or 8CC when dialing a mandatory area code Even though trunk code is not needed for calls within the same geographical area recent convention adds the default trunk code to the phone number notation 8 AAAA BBBBBB For mandatory area code dealing plans notation 8 AAAA BBBBBB is used These formats are a mix of Microsoft format and E123 local notation Mobile phones require full 10digit number which starts with 3digit nongeographical area codes 900990 For international calls abroad or international roaming calls to Russia E123 international notation with an international call prefix  is the only allowed calling number format For local calls both 8 and 7 are accepted as a trunk code Old BBBBBBB Old with area code AAA BBBBBBB Conventional 8 AAA BBBBBBB Microsoft 7 AAA BBBBBBB Conventional mandatory area code 8 AAA BBBBBBB E123 international 7 AAA BBB BB BB Spanish telephone numbers have nine digits starting with 9 or 8 for fixed lines excluding 90x and 80x or with 6 or 7 for mobile phones The first group in fixed lines always identifies the dialed province That group might be of 2 or 3 digits for example 91 and 81 are for Madrid while 925 and 825 are for Toledo The second group is always of 3 digits as it formerly identified the telephone exchange it now identifies the telephone area When the first group has two digits as in Madrid the number is usually written in four groups of 2322 digits AB CCC DD DD When the first group has three digits as in Toledo the number is usually written in 3 groups of 3 digits ABB CCC DDD but the form 3222 ABB CC CD DD is not uncommon Mobile numbers are usually grouped by threes ABB CCC CCC but the form 3222 is also seen Swedish telephone numbers have between eight and ten digits They start with a two to four digit area code A three digit code starting with 07 indicates that the number is for a mobile phone All national numbers start with one leading 0 and international destinations are specified by the prefix 00 or  The numbers are written with the area code followed by a hyphen and then two to three groups of digits separated by spaces8 National 10 digit 0AXXX XXX XX 0AAXXX XX XX

usually written 0AA BBB BB BB where 0AA is the national destination code and BBB BB BB is the subscriber number The entire number must always be dialed including the leading 0 even if calling within a local area therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number According to international convention numbers are sometimes written 41 AA BBB BB BB to include the country calling code Certain nationwide destination codes such as for tollfree or premiumrate telephone numbers are written 0800 BBB BBB or 0900 BBB BBB Short numbers are used for emergency services such as 112 that are written 1CC or 1CCC In Turkey the format for telephone numbers is commonly seen as 0BBB AAA AA AA While landline numbers having the prefix 02BB AAA AA AA 03BB AAA AA AA or 04BB AAA AA AA9 mobile numbers have the prefix 05BB AAA AA AA Landline area codes are separated by cities and only one city Istanbul has two area codes 216 for the Asian side and 212 for the European side Mobile numbers however are separated by carriers There are three mobile carriers in Turkey Vodafone TR Turkcell and Turk Telekom Turkcell has the prefix 053B AAA AA AA Vodafone TR has the prefix 054B AAA AA AA and Turk Telekom has the prefix 055B AAA AA AA Since 9 November 2008 with the passing of the Number Carriability Regulation by ICTA mobile numbers can be carried from one mobile carrier to the other without having to change the prefix10 This caused dialing 05BB to call another number on the same carrier to become mandatory Calls to numbers which were carried to another operator are signaled by a unique sound upon dialing to signify that the recipient is on another network and alert them against potentially unwanted interconnection charges The same regulation passed on 10 September 2009 regarding landline numbers without the requirement to dial the prefix among numbers with the same geographical area sharing the same prefix The 0 on every prefix is an Area Code Exit code that must be dialed when a number with a different area code is being called So when calling from outside of Turkey those 0s are not dialed The dialing format when calling from outside Turkey is 90 BBB AAA AA AA and NOT 90 0BBB AAA AA AA Unlike the North American system the Country Exit Code isnt 011 but 00 So it is one 0 to exit area and one more 0 to exit the country There are many recommendations for recording phone numbers The most common in the world is Recommendation E123 E123 International Telecommunication Union11 and the standard format for Microsoft telephone numbers Microsoft12 There is an international format for recording a telephone number containing the country code settlement code and telephone number and the national format containing the settlement code and telephone number To record Ukrainian telephone numbers telephone codes for settlements do not have an initial zero longdistance prefix 0 380 44 123 45 67 E123 international format country code settlement code and telephone number are separated by spaces 044 123 45 67 E123 national format longdistance prefix and city code in parentheses national format longdistance prefix and settlement code in parentheses due to possible confusion needs constant additional clarification  28 11  the phone number is separated from the code and separated by spaces 380 44 1234567 Microsoft international format country code space code settlement code in brackets space code telephone number Dialling codes also known as area codes are optional for local callers often surrounded by parentheses or separated with a dash though there are trials running to make them mandatory13 and are followed by the customers telephone number Codes with the form 02x are followed by 8digit local numbers and are usually written as 02x AAAA AAAA or 02x AAAA AAAA Area codes with the form 011x or 01x1 are used for many of the major population centres in the UK are always followed by 7digit local numbers and are usually written as 01xx AAA BBBB 01xx AAA BBBB or 01x1AAA BBBB the latter formerly the recommended format for six major metropolitan areas in the UK Other area codes have the form 01xxx with 5 or 6 figure local numbers written as 01xxx or 01xxx followed by subscriber number AAAAA or AAAAAA or have the form 01xx xx with 4 or 5 figure local numbers written as 01xx xx or 01xx xx followed by subscriber number AAAA or AAAAA Numbers for mobile phones and pagers are formatted as 07AAA BBBBBB and most other nongeographic numbers are 10 figures in length excluding trunk digit 0 and formatted as 0AAA BBB BBBB However these numbers are sometimes written in other formats 9 figure freephone numbers are 0500 AAAAAA and 0800 AAAAAA and there is one number of 8 figures length 0800 1111 Childline Domestically there are also a number of special service numbers such as 100 for the operator 123 for the speaking clock and 155 for the international operator as well as 118 AAA for various directory enquiry services and 116 AAA for various helplines For some services the number you call will depend on which operator you use to connect the call 112 and 999 work for calling the emergency services These numbers cannot be called from abroad When calling from abroad the initial 0 trunk prefix is not required it is however commonplace to represent telephone numbers with both the international code and the 0 trunk prefix  which is typically placed within parentheses  but this representation is inconsistent with the E123 international standard14 Twentyfour countries and territories share the North American Numbering Plan NANP with a single country code 1 The formatting convention for telephone numbers is NPA NXXXXXX where NPA is the threedigit area code and NXXXXXX is the sevendigit subscriber number15 NPA has the same syntax of NXX since the implementation of interchangeable area codes in 1995 The prefix NXX of the subscriber number is the central office code unique in the numbering plan area The place holder N stands for the digits 2 to 9 as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1 It is a closed telephone numbering plan in which all subscriber telephone numbers have seven digits in addition to the threedigit area code Under allnumber calling a numbering plan introduced around 1960 local calls within an area code were placed by dialing NXXXXXX omitting the area code known as sevendigit dialing Only calling a destination in a different area code required dialing the destination area code known as tendigit dialing Due to the need for a larger telephone number pool in many regions sevendigit dialing is becoming rare in the United States With the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century many metropolitan areas saw the introduction of additional area codes Multiple area codes were assigned to the same numbering plan area a configuration known as an overlay numbering plan Calls within an overlay are still local calls despite the need for tendigit dialing In general placing longdistance calls requires dialing the trunk code 1 but this may be optional in some areas Canada is a member of the North American Numbering Plan but administers its numbering resources individually under guidance from the NANP Administrator The Canadian government has stated on its Language Portal of Canada that telephone numbers are to be written with a hyphen between each sequence as follows 1NPANXXXXXX or NPANXXXXXX16 10digit dialing is now required throughout most of Canada including all of British Columbia Alberta Saskatchewan Manitoba Quebec Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island as well as most of Ontario Areas not yet requiring 10digit dialing are Ontarios 807 area code Newfoundland and Labrador New Brunswick the Yukon Northwest Territories and Nunavut although 10digit dialing may be accepted in some of these areas In the province of Qubec where French is the first language the Office qubcois de la langue franaise has established that telephone numbers must be written with spaces first and then a hyphen for the last sequence as follows 1 NPA NXXXXXX17 Mexican telephone numbers have ten digits They can consist of a twodigit NN area code and an eightdigit local number ABCD XXXX or a threedigit area code NNN with a sevendigit local number ABC XXXX As of August 3 2019 all the indicators and access codes 01 044 045 are deprecated therefore all telephone numbers for landline or mobile service are dialed with ten digits18 The formatting convention of a telephone number is ABCD XXXX or NN ABCD XXXX or NN ABCDXXXX ABC XX XX or NNN ABC XXXX or NNN ABCXXXX The international country code prefix for Mexico is 52 When dialing a number it must be formatted as plus sign  country code  10digit number eg 52 NNN ABC XXXX Some Central American countries write the country code for their own and other Central American countries in parentheses instead of using a  sign as recommended by E123 For example for a number in Costa Rica they would write 506 22222222 instead of 506 22222222 On the other hand Guatemala does have the custom of using the  sign It is quite common for Central American businesses to write the whole phone number including the country code in parentheses on business cards signs stationery etc Costa Rican telephone numbers have eight digits and are usually written in the format 2NNNNNNN for landlines 8NNNNNNN for mobile telephone numbers from local telephone company ICE 6NNNNNNN for mobile telephone numbers from Movistar and 7NNNNNNN for mobile phone numbers from Claro19 Tollfree numbers use the format 800NNNNNNN and premiumrate telephone numbers are written 90xNNNNNNN where x varies according to the type of service offered There are also short numbers for emergencies such as 911 When Costa Rica switched from 7 to 8digit numbers it used a scheme similar to the 8digit number scheme already in place in El Salvador at that time El Salvadoran telephone numbers have eight digits usually written in the format 2NNNNNNN for landline use and 7NNNNNNN for mobile telephone numbers Premiumrate numbers start with a 9 Guatemalan telephone numbers have eight digits and written in the format 2NNNNNNN for landlines in Guatemala City 6NNNNNNN for landlines for the rest of municipalities in the Guatemala Department and 7NNNNNNN for landlines in Rural Guatemala  rest of country Nongeographic numbers mobile are 5NNNNNNN 4NNNNNNN and 3NNNNNNN Within each area there are different service providers The following 3 digits indicate the service provider However their assignment is on a firstcome firstserved basis Additionally there are special numbers with the following conventions 3 digit numbers for emergency systems four digit numbers 15NN for information and governmental institutions and 17NN for commercial and banking institutions with a high call influx 6 digit numbers for Telephone carriers numbers and making operator assisted calls collect calls These calls are billed at different rates 1800 Tollfree calls redirected to out of country offices and 1801 Local tollfree calls20 Honduran telephone numbers have either seven digits for landlines which are usually written NNNNNNN or eight digits for mobile numbers which are written NNNNNNNN The fact that landline and mobile numbers are different lengths sometimes causes confusion In 2010 an additional digit 2 was added to the start of land line numbers thus standardizing the length at eight digits Argentine telephone numbers always consist of 11 digits including the geographical area code The area code can have 3 4 or 5 digits the first being always 0 indicative of longdistance calls Moreover in 1999 the whole country except Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires was divided into two zones Roughly and with exceptions one includes most of the northern half of the country and the other most of the southern half though the actual reason for this division is not geographical but the fact that each zone is administered by a different company So the second digit of area codes can be 1 only in Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires code 011 or else a 2 for towns in the southern half of the country or a 3 for the northern half For example 011 for Buenos Aires 0341 for Rosario 02627 for San Rafael And the subscribers number will accordingly have 6 7 or 8 digits to complete the eleven digits Phone numbers are mostly written as 011 xxxxxxxx Note that only the 011 code has 3 digits 0xxx xxxxxxx or 0xxxx xxxxxx The area code is usually written between brackets In 1999 a general reform was introduced to telephone numbers including the 1 2 and 3 for area codes as explained above and adding a 4 at the beginning of all subscribers numbers However since the reform some local numbers starting with a 5 are beginning to appear Moreover a hyphen is usually placed to separate the last four digits Code areas do not usually include one single city or town but several neighbouring towns So the part before the hyphen called a prefix is usually indicative of either a town within the code area or even of a part of a larger city which is assigned several prefixes As a matter of fact each area code has only a limited number of prefixes assigned and these are locally limited within the area For example the 0342 area has numbers with a 456 prefix mostly located in the centre of Santa Fe It also has numbers with a 460 prefix usually for phone lines in the north east of the city And there are lines with a 474 prefix located in Santo Tom But no 444 prefix exists within this area As for the part after the hyphen it may usually be any succession of four digits though sometimes a prefix is shared by two or more small towns and then the first digit after the hyphen carries the distinction between towns Sometimes a prefix is reserved for official numbers that is for offices depending on the national provincial or local state In the 0342 area this is 457 and phones within this prefix communicate with each other by simply dialing the four final digits though from other phones the prefix must be dialled as well Mobile phones use the same area codes as landline telephones but the number begins with a 15 added to a string of 6 7 or 8 digits just as described above After the 15 the remainder of the number can start with a 3 a 4 a 5 or a 6 This 15 may be dropped when a call is made to a mobile phone in a different code area And when sending text messages the receivers number is best dialled both without the 15 and with the longdistance code even if both sender and receiver share a code area but without the initial 0 To sum up given the mobile phone 011 (154) 123-4567 you will call it by dialing (154) 123-4567 within the same code area 011 (154) 123-4567 from a different code area including or omitting the 15 And you will send messages to 11 41234567 even when your phone has also a 011 number Two sorts of special numbers exist in Argentina On the one hand threedigit numbers are used for special services such as to call the police fire brigade or emergency doctors as well as to hear the official time Also telephone companies have threedigit numbers to report a problem in the lines or to ask for another subscribers number when a paper directory is not available Additionally there are other longer numbers These include but are not limited to 0800 xxx abcd 0810 xxx abcd 0600 xxx abcd where the xxx indicates the same digit dialled three times and a b c and d may each be any of the ten digits 0800 lines are used by companies and it is the receiver and not the caller who pays for the call so that potential clients are encouraged to contact business companies for free 0810 lines are paid by the caller but the cost is for a local call even if you are calling from a different area The remaining is covered by the receiver And 0600 numbers are special more expensive lines that serve such purposes as TV games fund collecting for charity companies hot lines etc Basically a part of the extra money charged to the caller is sent to the owner of the line Often the abcd or even xxxabcd part of the number is chosen if available to form a word that is representative of the company holding the number Brazil is divided into 67 twodigit geographical area codes all of which with eightdigit numbers in the format AA NNNNNNNN except for cell phones which contain nine digits usually in the format AA 9NNNNNNNN Peru uses 2digit area codes followed by 6digit subscriber numbers outside of Lima In Lima the area code is 1 and the subscriber number has seven digits divided XXX XXXX The trunk 0 is often used especially for numbers outside Lima For example a phone number in Arequipa might be written 054 XXXXXX Cellphone numbers used to have eight digits with the first digit always being 9 In 2008 an additional digit was added to cellphone numbers while land numbers remained the same The previous convention for cell numbers in Lima was usually 9XXX XXXX though 9XXX XXXX was also used With the new 9digit number the form 9XX XXX XXX is becoming increasingly common as opposed to 9 XXXX XXXX 9X XXX XXXX or 9XXXX XXXX Outside Lima cellphone numbers used to be 9 followed by six digits ie 9 XXX XXX The 2008 changes were somewhat more complicated In four departments similar to states a 2 digit code now has to be entered before the 9 In the example of Arequipa the code of 95 has to be entered before the 9 so the new numeration is 959 XXX XXX The other codes are 94 for La Libertad Trujillo 96 for Piura and 97 for Lambayeque Chiclayo In the other 19 rural departments the 9 is followed by the departments 2digit area code then the 6digit subscriber number For example the area code for Cusco is 84 so their new cellphone numeration is 984 XXX XXX The effect is that all Peruvian cellphone numbers now have nine digits under the old system they had eight digits in Lima and 7 everywhere else21 Long distance calling Short code  Karachi and Lahore now have eight digit phone numbers In the near future this will be extended to other metros  Daily Times Pakistan 20090708 Retrieved 20091001  Philippines Landline Telephone Numbering Plan since 6

natural language processing news news books scholar jstor may 2024 learn how and when to remove this message natural language processing natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence it is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics typically data is collected in text corpora using either rulebased statistical or neuralbased approaches in machine learning and deep learning major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s1 already in 1950 alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language the premise of symbolic natural language processing is wellsummarized by john searles chinese room experiment given a collection of rules eg a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other natural language processing tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s the georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty russian sentences into english the authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem2 however real progress was much slower and after the alpac report in 1966 which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced little further research in machine translation was conducted in america though some research continued elsewhere such as japan and europe3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were shrdlu a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and eliza a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist written by joseph weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 using almost no information about human thought or emotion eliza sometimes provided a startlingly humanlike interaction when the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base eliza might provide a generic response for example responding to my head hurts with why do you say your head hurts ross quillians successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time4 1970s during the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured realworld information into computerunderstandable data examples are margie schank 1975 surface-to-air missile cullingford 1978 pam wilensky 1978 talespin meehan 1976 scruple lehnert 1977 politics carbonell 1979 and plot units lehnert 1981 during this time the first chatterbots were written eg parry 1980s the 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in natural language processing focus areas of the time included research on rulebased parsing eg the development of hpsg as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology eg twolevel morphology5 semantics eg lesk algorithm reference eg within centering theory6 and other areas of natural language understanding eg in the rhetorical structure theory other lines of research were continued eg the development of chatterbots with racter and jabberwacky an important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period7 up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing8 1990s many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in natural language processing occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research such as ibm alignment models these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government however most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems as a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s with the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data have become available since the mid1990s research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semisupervised learning algorithms such algorithms can learn from data that has not been handannotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and nonannotated data generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data however there is an enormous amount of nonannotated data available including among other things the entire content of the world wide web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical in 2003 word ngram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was outperformed by a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a central processing unit cluster in language modelling by yoshua bengio with coauthors9 in 2010 tom mikolov then a phd student at brno university of technology with coauthors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling10 and in the following years he went on to develop word2vec in the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing that popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques1112 can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling13 and parsing1415 this is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where natural language processing helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care16 or protect patient privacy17 symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by army intelligence in general and by natural language processing in particular1819 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rulebased approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar eg containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input eg with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rulebased systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rulebased systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of llms in 2023 before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods eg for the machine translation of lowresource languages such as provided by the apertium system for preprocessing in natural language processing pipelines eg tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of natural language processing pipelines eg for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses in the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of army intelligence winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches2021 the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since 201522 the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks23 and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore neural machine translation based on thennewlyinvented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below part of a series on key

and apparent comprehension of natural language more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of natural language processing see trends among conll shared tasks above cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses47 cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes48 cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics49 especially during the age of symbolic natural language processing the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing natural language processing algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics50 with two defining aspects apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author51 for example consider the english word big when used in a comparison that is a big tree the authors intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience when used metaphorically tomorrow is a big day the authors intent to imply importance the intent behind other usages like in she is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive natural language processing algorithm alike without additional information assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed eg by means of a probabilistic contextfree grammar pcfg the mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in united states patent 9269353 ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of natural language processing but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar53 functional grammar54 construction grammar55 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg actr however with limited uptake in mainstream natural language processing as measured by presence on major conferences56 of the acl more recently ideas of cognitive natural language processing have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability eg under the notion of cognitive ai57 likewise ideas of cognitive natural language processing are inherent to neural models multimodal natural language processing although rarely made explicit58 and developments in

models comparable to pathological phenomena in mathematics typically created using thought experiments rather than the systematic investigation of typical phenomena that occur in realworld data as is the case in corpus linguistics the creation and use of such corpora of realworld data is a fundamental part of machinelearning algorithms for natural language processing in addition theoretical underpinnings of chomskyan linguistics such as the socalled poverty of the stimulus argument entail that general learning algorithms as are typically used in machine learning cannot be successful in

portal vte v t e computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the computational modelling of natural language as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions in general computational linguistics draws upon linguistics computer science artificial intelligence mathematics logic philosophy cognitive science cognitive psychology psycholinguistics anthropology and neuroscience among others the field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the united states in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages particularly russian scientific journals into english1 since rulebased approaches were able to make arithmetic systematic calculations much faster and more accurately than humans it was expected that lexicon morphology syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules as well after the failure of rulebased approaches david hays2 coined the term in order to distinguish the field from army intelligence and cofounded both the association for computational linguistics acl and the international committee on computational linguistics iccl in the 1970s and 1980s what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing34 in order to be able to meticulously study the english language an annotated text corpus was much needed the penn treebank5 was one of the most used corpora it consisted of ibm computer manuals transcribed telephone conversations and other texts together containing over 45 million words of american english annotated using both partofspeech tagging and syntactic bracketing6 japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of lognormality was found in relation to sentence length7 the fact that during language acquisition children are largely only exposed to positive evidence8 meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided and no evidence for what is not correct9 was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s10 it has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span11 which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children11 robots have been used to test linguistic theories12 enabled to learn as children might models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions perceptions and effects were created and linked to spoken words crucially these robots were able to acquire functioning wordtomeaning mappings without needing grammatical structure using the price

history timeline progress army intelligence winter army intelligence boom timeline progress army intelligence winter army intelligence boom glossary glossary glossary vte v t e machine learning milliliter is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions1 quick progress in the field of deep learning beginning in 2010s allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance2 milliliter finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine34 the application of milliliter to business problems is known as predictive analytics statistics and mathematical optimization mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis eda via unsupervised learning67 from a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct political action committee learning provides a framework for describing machine learning the term machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence89 the synonym selfteaching computers was also used in this time period1011 although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when arthur samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes12 in 1949 canadian psychologist donald hebb published the book the organization of behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells13 hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how ais and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data12 other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician walter pitts and warren mcculloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes12 by the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called cybertron had been developed by raytheon company to analyze sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning it was repetitively trained by a human operatorteacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions14 a representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was nilssons book on learning machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification15 interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by duda and hart in 197316 in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal17 tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e18 this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do19 modernday machine learning has two objectives one is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models a hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions20 as a scientific endeavor machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence army intelligence in the early days of army intelligence as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics22 probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis23 488 however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between army intelligence and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation23 488 by 1980 expert systems had come to dominate army intelligence and statistics was out of favor24 work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within army intelligence leading to inductive logic programmingilp but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of army intelligence proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval23 708710 755 neural networks research had been abandoned by army intelligence and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mid1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation23 25 machine learning milliliter reorganized and recognized as its own field started to flourish in the 1990s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from army intelligence and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory24 there is a close connection between machine learning and compression a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history this equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence252627 an alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors and compressionbased similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces for each compressor c we define an associated vector space such that c maps an input string x corresponding to the vector norm x an exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space instead feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods lzw lz77 and ppm28 according to aixi theory a connection more directly explained in hutter prize the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x for example in that model a zip files compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software since you can not unzip it without both but there may be an even smaller combined form examples of aipowered audiovideo compression software include nvidia maxine aivc29 examples of software that can perform aipowered image compression include opencv tensorflow matlabs image processing toolbox ipt and highfidelity generative image compression30 in unsupervised machine learning kmeans clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters this technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression31 data compression aims to reduce the size of data files enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission kmeans clustering an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters k each represented by the centroid of its points this process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points particularly beneficial in image and signal processing kmeans clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space32 machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples34 characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns35 according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics36 he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field36 conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set in addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis in contrast machine learning is not built on a prestructured model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns the more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be37 leo breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model38 wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning39 analytical and computational techniques derived from deeprooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to largescale problems including machine learning eg to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks40 statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics41 a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience542 generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning political action committee model because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer43 in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent as it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback thats analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize5 although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems444546 supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs47 the data known as training data consists of a set of training examples each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs48 an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task18 types of supervisedlearning algorithms include active learning classification and regression49 classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range as an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person or the future temperature 50 similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are it has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled classified or categorized instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction7 and density estimation51 unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pangenome52 cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity a special type of unsupervised learning called selfsupervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself5455 semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy in weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets56 reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulationbased optimization multiagent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques57 reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables58 in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca pca involves changing higherdimensional data eg three-d to a smaller space eg second the manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this threefold categorization and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system for example topic modeling metalearning59 selflearning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array caa60 it is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice the caa selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion61 the selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix w was such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s compute emotion of being in the consequence situation vs update crossbar memory was was vs it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goalseeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations62 several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training63 classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization64 and various forms of clustering656667 manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors68 deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data69 feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however realworld data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix the method is strongly nphard and difficult to solve approximately70 a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the ksvd algorithm sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot71 in data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data72 typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions73 in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the microclusters formed by these patterns74 three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist75 unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection semisupervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning7677 and finally metalearning eg maml association rule learning is a rulebased machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness78 rulebased machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge the defining characteristic of a rulebased machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction79 rulebased machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal tomasz imieliski and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in largescale transaction data recorded by pointofsale polonium systems in supermarkets80 for example the rule o n i o n s p o t a t o e s b u r g e r displaystyle mathrm onionspotatoes rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements in addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics in contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions learning classifier systems lcs are a family of rulebased machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning they seek to identify a set of contextdependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions81 inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting828384 shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in 1981 a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples85 the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a wellordered set a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that after being trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data during training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the models internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions86 by extension the term model can refer to several levels of specificity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned87 various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition88 decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves it is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making in data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decisionmaking supportvector machines svms also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category89 an svm training algorithm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel90 logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dekagram for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a predefined covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations given a set of observed points or inputoutput examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization a genetic algorithm tabun is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s9293 conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms94 the theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or dempstershafer theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability possibility and imprecise probability theories these theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined eg dempsters rule of combination just like how in a pmfbased bayesian approachclarification needed would combine probabilities however there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification these belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learners decision boundary low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving49 however the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions when training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model trained models derived from biased or nonevaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions biased models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server this also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices for example gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google95 there are many applications for machine learning including agriculture anatomy adaptive website affective computing astronomy automated decisionmaking banking behaviorism bioinformatics brainmachine interfaces cheminformatics citizen science climate science computer networks computer vision creditcard fraud detection data quality deoxyribonucleic acid sequence classification economics financial market analysis96 general game playing handwriting recognition healthcare information retrieval insurance

monitoring syntactic pattern recognition telecommunication theorem proving timeseries forecasting tomographic reconstruction97 user behavior analytics in 2006 the mediaservices provider netflix held the first netflix prize competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10 a joint team made up of researchers from att labsresearch in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in 2009 for 1 million98 shortly after the prize was awarded netflix realized that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly99 in 2010 the wall street journal wrote about the firm rebellion research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis100 in 2012 cofounder of sun microsystems vinod khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software101 in 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists102 in 2019 springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning103 in 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for covid19104 machine learning was recently applied to predict the proenvironmental behavior of travelers105 recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphones performance and thermal behavior based on the users interaction with the phone106107108 when applied correctly machine learning algorithms mlas can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting by employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts mlas can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like ols109 recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes110 machine learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes111112113 other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires114115 although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machinelearning programs often fail to deliver expected results116117118 reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems119 the black box theory poses another yet significant challenge black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data120 the house of lords select committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individuals life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes120 in 2018 a selfdriving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision121 attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested122123 microsofts bing chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users124 machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves125 different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data when trained on humanmade data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society126 language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases127128 in an experiment carried out by propublica an investigative journalism organization a machine learning algorithms insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants129 in 2015 google photos would often tag black people as gorillas129 and in 2018 this still was not well resolved but google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all130 similar issues with recognizing nonwhite people have been found in many other systems131 in 2016 microsoft tested tay a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language132 because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains133 concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including feifei li who reminds engineers that theres nothing artificial about army intelligence its inspired by people its created by people andmost importantlyit impacts people it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility134 explainable army intelligence xai or interpretable army intelligence or explainable machine learning xml is artificial intelligence army intelligence in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai135 it contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an army intelligence arrived at a specific decision136 by refining the mental models of users of aipowered systems and dismantling their misconceptions xai promises to help users perform more effectively xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is137 learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses138 a realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies139140 adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations for some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel141 machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation andor evasion via adversarial machine learning142 researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying eg for categories spam and wellvisible not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed andor trained by third parties parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided possibly including whitebox access143144145 classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k1 subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy146 in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators the total operating characteristic toc is an effective method to express a models diagnostic ability toc shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc and rocs associated area under the curve auc147 machine learning poses a host of ethical questions systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices148 for example in 1988 the uks commission for racial equality found that st georges medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have noneuropean sounding names126 using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants149150 another example includes predictive policing company geoliticas predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of overpolicing in lowincome and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data129 while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of army intelligence for machine learnings vulnerability to biases151 in fact according to research carried out by the computing research association cra in 2021 female faculty merely make up 161 of all faculty members who focus on army intelligence among several universities around the world152 furthermore among the group of new united states resident army intelligence phd graduates 45 identified as white 224 as asian 32 as hispanic and 24 as african american which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai152 army intelligence can be wellequipped to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information these decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning153 because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases154155 other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines156 this is especially true in the united states where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated157 since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units158 by 2019 graphic processing units gpus often with aispecific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud ai159 openai estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet 2012 to alphazero 2017 and found a 300000fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of 34 months160161 a physical neural network or neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to softwarebased approaches more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse162163 embedded machine learning is a subfield of machine learning where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers164165166 running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets embedded machine learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration167168 using approximate computing169 optimization of machine learning models and many more170171 pruning quantization knowledge distillation lowrank factorization network architecture

broadcasting in many ways including quality9 reach frequency usability relevancy and permanence10 social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system many sources to many receivers while traditional media operate under a monologic transmission model one source to many receivers for instance a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city11 social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers including exposure to inappropriate content exploitation by adults sleep problems attention problems feelings of exclusion and various mental health maladies1213 social media has also received criticism as worsening political polarization and undermining democracy the plato system was launched in 1960 at the university of illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by control data corporation it offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as notes platos messageforum application termtalk its instantmessaging feature talkomatic perhaps the first online chat room news report a crowdsourced online newspaper and blog and access lists enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users for example only friends classmates or coworkers arpanet which came online in 1967 had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of nongovernmentbusiness ideas and communication as evidenced by the network etiquette or netiquette described in a 1982 handbook on computing at mits artificial intelligence laboratory14 arpanet evolved into the internet in the 1990s15 usenet conceived by tom truscott and jim ellis in 1979 at the university of north carolina at chapel hill and duke university was the first open social media app established in 1980 a precursor of the electronic bulletin board system bulletin board system known as community memory appeared by 1973 mainstream bbss arrived with the computer bulletin board system in chicago which launched on february 16 1978 before long most major united states cities had more than one bulletin board system running on trs80 apple two atari 8bit computers ibm personal computer commodore 64 sinclair and others compuserve prodigy and aol were three of the largest bulletin board system companies and were the first to migrate to the internet in the 1990s between the mid1980s and the mid1990s bbses numbered in the tens of thousands in north america alone16 message forums were the signature bulletin board system phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s in 1991 tim bernerslee integrated hypertext markup language hypertext software with the internet creating the world wide web this breakthrough led to an explosion of blogs list servers and email services message forums migrated to the web and evolved into internet forums supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously these early textbased systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century aided by digital cameras and camera phones17 the evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent of web 206 social media started in the mid1990s with the invention of platforms like geocities classmatescom and sixdegreescom18 while instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time sixdegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously it boasted features like profiles friends lists and school affiliations making it the very first social networking site1819 the platforms name was inspired by the six degrees of separation concept which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else20 in the early 2000s social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes of friendster and myspace followed by facebook youtube and twitter21 research from 2015 reported that globally users spent 22 of their online time on social networks22 likely fueled by the availability of smartphones23

its ubiquity since users no longer have to be at a desk in order to participate on a computer mobile services can further make use of the users immediate location to offer information connections or services relevant to that location according to andreas kaplan mobile social media activities fall among four types27 spacetimers location and timesensitive exchange of messages with relevance for a specific location at a specific point in time posting about a traffic jam spacelocators only location sensitive postsmessages with relevance for a specific location read later by others eg a restaurant review quicktimers only time sensitive transfer of traditional social media mobile apps to increase immediacy eg posting status updates slowtimers neither location nor time sensitive transfer of traditional social media applications to mobile devices eg watching a video certain content has the potential to spread virally an analogy for the way viral infections spread contagiously from individual to individual one user spreads a post across their network which leads those users to follow suit a post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours virality is not guaranteed few posts make the transition viral marketing campaigns are particularly attractive to businesses because they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns nonprofit organizations and activists may also attempt to spread content virally social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content such as xs and facebooks like option28 bots are automated programs that operate on the internet29 they automate many communication tasks this has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers30 chatbots and social bots are programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking commenting and following31 bots have also been developed to facilitate social media marketing32 bots have led the marketing industry into an analytical crisis as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions33 some bots violate platforms terms of use which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically34 bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions35 cyborgseither botassisted humans or humanassisted bots35are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes from spreading fake news to creating marketing buzz363738 a common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time39 a human writes a post content

healthcare workers and systems became more aware of social media as a place people were getting health information during the covid19 pandemic social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems68 this also led to the spread of disinformation on december 11 2020 the center for disease control and prevention put out a call to action managing the infodemic69 some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on their twitter data70 promotion of the joint usage of pedsicu and covid19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care70 however others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction as it became an increasingly important context and therefore source of social validation and reinforcement and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful71 governments may use social media to for example72 inform their opinions to public interact with citizens foster citizen participation further open government analyzemonitor public opinion and activities educate the

improve their image especially among the youth in january 2021 egyptian authorities were reported to be using instagram influencers as part of its media ambassadors program the program was designed to revamp egypts image and to counter the bad press egypt had received because of the countrys human rights record saudi arabia and the united arab emirates participated in similar programs80 similarly dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism however dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities or to criticize the city politics or religion the content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays dubai in a negative light81 many businesses use social media for marketing branding82

use can lead to addictionlike symptoms these symptoms include compulsive checking mood modification and withdrawal when not using social media which can result in decreased facetoface social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness179 a 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media it concluded that blue light from computerphone displaysand the frequency rather than the duration of time spent predicted disturbed sleep termed obsessive checking183 the association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults184 a recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance the median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61 females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance185 many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from

association with sleep disturbance was not established187 one studied effect of social media is facebook depression which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media8 this may lead to reclusiveness which can increase loneliness and low selfesteem8 social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling184 studies report childrens selfesteem is positively affected by

other technology are at a disadvantage for they are unable or less able to connect with others find and apply for jobs shop and learn197199 many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content204205 because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them206 aviv ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content207 but could be designed to reduce polarization instead208 in 2017 facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity misinformation and lowquality news209 some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts210211207 some advocate for media literacy as a solution212 others argue that less social media206 or more local journalism213214215 could help address political polarization a 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes216 stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations for example during the covid19 pandemic youth

intercultural communication despite different ways of communicating in various cultures219 social media has affected the way youth communicate by introducing new forms of language220 novel acronyms save time as illustrated by lol which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud the hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion221 for some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills222 what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media223 the american academy of pediatrics reported that bullying the making of noninclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk224225226227 however adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online228 social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities8 this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it july 2024 in july 2014 in response to wikileaks release of a secret suppression order made by the victorian supreme court media lawyers were quoted in the australian media to the effect that anyone who tweets a link to the wikileaks report posts it on facebook or shares it in any way online could also face charges229 on 27 july 2020 in egypt two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting tiktok videos which the government claimed as violating family values230 in the 2014 thai coup dtat the public was explicitly instructed not to share or like dissenting views on social media or face prisoncitation needed historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented they set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore the united states enacted the communications decency act in 1996 section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 47 usc 230c1 in 2024 legislation was enacted in florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14 and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval231232 the european union initially took a similar approach233 however in 2020 the european commission presented two legislative proposals the digital services act dsa and the digital markets act dma both proposals were enacted in july 2022 the dsa entered into force on 17 february 2024 the dma in march 2024234 this legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by meps what is illegal offline must also be illegal online235 very large online platforms must therefore among other things delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the european commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the european commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 violators could face a complete ban in europe or fines of up to 6 of global sales such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers237 enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance238 the dsa allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction according to patrick breyer from the german pirate party a problem could arise from the hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of victor orban as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied euwide239 2018 nobel laureate paul romer240 advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms237 similar to a carbon tax negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms241 assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them however consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax another proposal is to invoke competition law242 the idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law this would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines in a 2024 opinion piece megan moreno and jenny radesky professors of pediatrics wrote about the need for nuanced policy243 they regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful they commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages244 in june 2024 united states surgeon general vivek murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people245 the business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them this strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see platforms such as x add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues246 the enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability247 impact on concentration mental health248 content ownership and the meaning of interactions and poor crossplatform interoperability249 decrease in facetoface interactions cyberbullying sexual predation particularly of children and child pornography250251 in 2007 andrew keen wrote out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the internet was the law of digital darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering252 social media has become a regular source of news and information a 2021 pew research center poll reported roughly 70 of users regularly get news from social media4 despite the presence of fake news and misinformation platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy and many do not vet content at all although in some cases content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced253254255 content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance responding instead to the contents virality in 2018 researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70 faster than truthful news on x7 social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users10 some platforms attempt to discover and block bots with limited success11 fake news seems to receive more user engagement possibly because it is relatively novel engaging users curiosity and increasing spread23 fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event before conventional media are prepared to publish2016 social media mining is the process of obtaining data from usergenerated content on social media in order to extract actionable patterns form conclusions about users and act upon the information mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research the term is an analogy to the process of mining for minerals mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals likewise social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage online behaviour content sharing connections between individuals buying behaviour these patterns and trends are of interest to companies governments and notforprofit organizations as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies introduce programs products processes or services social media mining uses concepts from computer science data mining machine learning and statistics mining is based on social network analysis network science sociology ethnography optimization and mathematics it attempts to formally represent measure and model patterns from social media data256 in the 2010s major corporations governments and notforprofit organizations began mining to learn about customers clients and others platforms such as google facebook partnered with datalogix and bluekai conduct mining to target users with advertising257 scientists and machine learning researchers extract insights and design product features258 users may not understand how platforms use their data259 users tend to click through terms of use agreements without reading them leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users privacy malcolm gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated he concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves that expression likely has no impact beyond social media what he called highrisk activism involves strong relationships coordination commitment high risks and sacrifice261 gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that social networks are effective at increasing participationby lessening the level of motivation that participation requires261 according to him facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice261 disputing gladwells theory a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity262 social media content is generated by users however content ownership is defined by the terms of service to which users agree platforms control access to the content and may make it available to third parties263 although platforms terms differ generally they all give permission to utilize users copyrighted works at the platforms discretion264 after its acquisition by facebook in 2012 instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users265266 it then reversed these changes with thenceo kevin systrom promising to update the terms of service267268 privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data information is captured without the users knowing consent data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes269263 information may be offered for third party use young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators270 while social media users claim to want to keep their data private their behavior does not reflect that concern as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles in addition platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles this data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising271 a 2014 pew research center survey reported that 91 of americans agree or strongly agree that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used some 80 of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms and 64 said the government should do more to regulate advertisers272 in 2019 united kingdom legislators criticized facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data273 in 2019 the pentagon issued guidance to the military coast guard and other government agencies that identified the potential risk associated with using the tiktok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information274 as a result the military coast guard transportation security administration and department of homeland security banned the installation and use of tiktok on government devices275 in 2020 the united states government attempted to ban tiktok and wechat from the states over national security concerns however a federal court blocked the move276 in 2024 the united states congress passed a low directing tiktoks parent company bytedance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the united states the company sued challenging the constitutionality of the ban277 internet addiction disorder iad also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use is a problematic compulsive use of the internet particularly on social media that impairs an individuals function over a prolonged period of time young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder278 with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online279 some experience health consequences from loss of sleep280 as they stay up to continue scrolling chatting and gaming281 excessive internet use is not recognized as a disorder by the world health organization the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm5 or the international classification of diseases icd11282 however gaming disorder appears in the icd11283 controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders definitions are not standardized or agreed upon complicating the development of evidencebased recommendations users under 30 access the internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse284 in 2011 the term facebook addiction disorder fad emerged285 fad is characterized by compulsive use of facebook a 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use and narcissism reporting fad was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables depression anxiety and stress symptoms286287 in 2020 the documentary the social dilemma reported concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social medias pursuit of addictive use for example when a user has not visited facebook for some time the platform varies its notifications attempting to lure them back it also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality288 whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous291 a study of americans aged 1215 reported that teenagers who used social media over three hoursday doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety292 platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content a 2023 study of australian youth reported that 57 had seen disturbingly violent content while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images293 further youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullyingcitation needed as result phones have been banned from some schools and some schools in the united states have blocked social media websites294 social media often features in political struggles in some countries internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens use of social media for example in 2013 some social media was banned in turkey after the taksim gezi park protests both x and youtube were temporarily suspended in the country by a courts decision a law granted immunity to telecommunications directorate terbium personnel the terbium was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order295 yet tbs 2014 blocking of x was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech296 internet censorship in the united states is the suppression of information published or viewed on the internet in the united states the first amendment of the united states constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal state and local government censorship free speech protections allow little governmentmandated internet content restrictions however the internet is highly regulated supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms297 gambling cyber security and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the us297 many governmentmandated attempts to regulate content have been barred often after lengthy legal battles298 however the government has exerted pressure indirectly with the exception of child pornography content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to removesuppress content following state encouragement or the threat of legal action299297 while the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable open source protocols such as activitypub have been adopted by platforms such as mastodon gnu social diaspora and friendica they operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteeroperated servers called the fediverse however in 2019 mastodon blocked gab from connecting to it claiming that it spread violent rightwing extremism305 in december 2019 x chief executive officer jack dorsey advocated an open and decentralized standard for social media he joined bluesky to bring it to reality306 deplatforming also called noplatforming is a form of internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their informationideas this typically involves suspension outright bans or reducing spread shadow banning307308 a number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on311 zack beauchamp of vox calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats312 the economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats313 informed dialogue a shared sense of reality mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media314 political polarization can be one byproduct315316317 this has implications for the likelihood of political violence318206 siva vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing antitrust laws195 andrew leonard describes polis as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus319320 according to likewar the weaponization of social media321 the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities corporations and governments but also extremist groups322 the use of social media by isis and alqaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers social media platforms and encryptedmessaging applications have been used to recruit members both locally and internationally323 platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content extreme nationalist groups and more prominently united states rightwing extremists have used similar online tactics as many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech several platforms became popular among rightwing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events these application became known as alttech platforms such as telegram parler and gab were used during the january 6 united states capitol attack to coordinate attacks324 members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians325 social media content persists unless the user deletes it after a user dies unless the platform is notified their content remains326 each platform has created guidelines for this situation327 in most cases on social media the platforms require a nextofkin to prove that the user is deceased and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a legacy status x328 the company works with an immediate family member to deactivate the account additionally x will not give the account to any other person regardless of the relationship facebook users have the option of having their account permanently deleted after death users can identify a legacy contact who would take over the account after instagram329 users can have the account memorialized or deleted

usually written as 0xxxxxxxxx or 0xx xxxxxxx where 0xx indicates an area code 0xx xxxxxx and 0xx thirty xxxx without hyphens are comprehensible as well the area code may have two digits for some cities such as seoul and gwacheon these two cities use the same area code and three digits for other cities such as incheon busan and most of the cities in gyeonggido the middle threedigit part is extended to four digits in many areas due to the increased number of telephone users in the international context 82 0xxxxxxxxx is commonly used as well for international calls 0 in the area code is often omitted because it is not necessary to dial 0 from foreign countries therefore it is better written as 820xxxxxxxxx or 820xxxxxxxxxx the plus sign is often added to the country code eg 82 0xxxxxxxxx or 820xxxxxxxxxx for mobile numbers 016490641 so on as with the landline home numbers the mobile numbers middle threedigit part is extended to four digits eg 016490641 due to the increased number of mobile phone users if a number starts with 070 the number does not belong to any particular area and is a number given by an internet telephone service in this case 070 is not usually put in the brackets neither nor in the business context the numbers in the format of 15xxxxxx and 16xxxxxx are business representative agency or customer services while the numbers starting with 080 eg 080xxxxxxx are also businessrelated numbers but are usually tollfree customer service centers also in this case 15xx 16xx or 070 are not put in the brackets neither nor there are national telephone services which have phone numbers in the format of 1xx or 1xxx without any area code for example 114 is for telephone yellow page 119 is for fireemergency number 112 is for police station center 131 is for weather forecast information 1333 is for traffic information and so on the number 111 is for reporting spies especially from north korea it used to be 113 so most of senior citizen still believe it is the number for reporting spies these numbers do not need any brackets if there are multiple numbers used for one personentity the symbol is usually used to avoid repetitions for example if one company has three phone numbers0311111111 (031) 111-1112 and 0311111113then they are shortened as in 03111111113 if the numbers are not consecutive then the last digit is written together with commas for example if a company has three numbers0311111111 (031) 111-1115 (031) 111-1119 then they are shortened as in (031) 111-1111 5 9 landline numbers in taiwan are written with the area code in

example 06 9756 4509 thais often confuse the current numbering system with the old provincial area code system which no longer exists as area codes were integrated into all phone numbers in 2005 because of this unofficially people often write numbers as 0xx xxx xxx 053 810 595 calling a thai phone number from outside thailand one drops the 0 and adds the 66 country code example 66 5381 05955 most australian telephone numbers have ten digits and are generally written 0a bbbb bbbb or 04xx thirty thirty for mobile telephone numbers where 0a is the optional area code 2378 and bbbb bbbb is the

the area code is often written within parentheses 0a bbbb bbbb mobile numbers should never have parentheses tendigit nongeographic numbers beginning with 1 are written 1x0y bbb bbb where x 8 for toll

enclosed in brackets although this is not strictly correct as the brackets denote optional parts of the number and the 0800 and 0508 is required6 recently with 8 digit mobile numbers becoming more common the prefix4 digits4 digits format has been adopted for readability 022 1234 5678 for international use the prefix 64 is substituted for the leading zero giving 64abbbbbbb for landlines and

thirdly the subscribers number b land lines always have nine digits they are prefixed by a zero followed by the zone prefix depending on the length of the zone prefix the subscribers number consists of either 6 or 7 digits hence land line numbers are written either 0aa bb bb bb or 0a bbb bb bb mobile phone numbers always consist of ten digits the first digit of the zone prefix of a mobile number is always 4 then follows 2 digits indicating to which mobile operators pool the number originally belonged when it was taken into usage the fourth digit represents a subgroup of this pool and has no additional meaning other than increasing the amount of possible numbers the subscribers number consists of six digits hence mobile phone numbers are written 04aa bb bb bb sometimes the last six digits are written in two groups of 3 digits to increase readability 04aa bbb bbb numbers are sometimes written with a slash in between the zone prefix and the subscribers number this is the case for both land lines and mobile phone numbers sometimes dots are written between the blocks of the subscribers number examples 0aabb bb bb 0aabbbbbb for mobile numbers 04aabb bb bb 04aabbbbbb or 04aabbbbbb the

aaab bbbbbb where aab or aaab is the 2 or 3digit national area code plus the first digit of the subscriber number and bbbbbbb or bbbbbb are the remaining digits of the subscriber number the entire number must always be dialed even if calling within the same local area therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number according to international convention numbers are sometimes written 30 aab bbbbbbb or 30 aaab bbbbbb to include the country calling code in hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two except for budapest the capital which has the area code 1 subscribers numbers have six digits in general numbers in budapest and cell phone numbers have seven digits phone numbers in iceland have seven digits and generally written in the form thirty xxxx or xxxxxxx phone numbers in ireland are part of an open numbering plan with varying number lengths the area code system is similar to that in some other northern european countries unlike the united kingdom irish fixed line numbering is divided into a number of regions which are except dublin further subdivided in a hierarchical structure with the largest town often but not always taking 0a1 area codes start with a trunk prefix 0 and extend for up to four digits but usually 3 followed by the local phone number of up to seven digits in industry jargon these area codes and prefixes are referred to as ndcs national dialing codes this is the term used by comreg and technical documents as they include nongeographic codes historically like the united kingdom the term venereal disease code subscriber trunk dialling was used however the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion dublin uses the shorter 01 code which is not further subdivided other cities and major towns usually have codes ending in 1 cork for example is 021 galway 091 limerick 061 etc the leading zero is always omitted when dialling from outside the country local phone numbers have either 5 6 or 7digits in 7digit numbering they are usually grouped as bbb bbbb 6digit numbers are grouped bbb bbb and 5digit numbers are normally all grouped together bbbbb grouping of numbers is not strictly adhered to but usually fairly consistent the area code should always be kept separated with a space or surrounded by brackets and not merged into the local number the use of hyphens is discouraged particularly on websites as it can prevent mobile browsers identifying the number as a clickable link for easier dialling fixed line numbers are normally presented as follows 01 bbb bbbb for a dublin number 7 digit 021 bbb bbbb for a cork number 7 digit 064 bbb bbbb for a killarney number 7 digit 061 bbb bbb for a limerick number 6 digit 098 bbbbb for a westport number 5 digit 0404 bbbbb for a wicklow number 5 digit area codes may also be surrounded by brackets but this practice is falling out of use as local dialing without the area code is optional on landlines and the area code must always be dialled on mobile phones the irish telecommunication regulator comreg has been gradually rationalising area codes by merging and extending local numbering to 7digits in the format 0aa bbb bbbb this is being carried out only where necessary to avoid disruption this means that varying fixed line number lengths will continue to exist in ireland for the foreseeable future mobile numbers are presented as follows 08a bbb bbbb brackets should not be used around the mobile prefix as it is never optional and must always be dialled even from another phone with the same prefix special rate numbers such as free phonetoll free and premium rate are usually grouped freephone 1800 bb bb bb or spoken as oneeighthundred local rate 1850 bb bb bb eighteenfifty 1550 bb bb bb read as fifteenfifty however for memorability this is not consistently adhered to alphanumeric characters can also be used in presenting numbers for added memorability but it is much less common than in north america for example 18aa 99 cab note these special rate numbers are not reachable from outside ireland7 phone numbers in italy have variable length theres no well established convention about how to group digits or which symbol to use but this is hardly an issue since all the digits are always dialed since 10 october 1995 operation decibel all telephone numbers in the netherlands have ten digits including the trunk prefix 0 the area code a is commonly separated with a dash and sometimes a space from the subscribers number b alternatively the area code including the trunk prefix can be enclosed in parentheses the length of the area code for landlines is either 2 or 3 digits depending on the population density of the area this leaves 7 or 6 digits for the subscribers number resulting in a format of either 0aabbbbbbb or 0aaabbbbbb cellphone numbers are assigned the 1digit area code 6 leaving eight digits for the subscribers number 06cbbbbbbb where subscribers number c is neither 6 nor 7 service numbers area codes 800 900 906 and 909 have either 4 or 7 remaining digits making them 8 or 11 digits in total 0aaabbbb or 0aaabbbbbbb the area code 14 has no trunk prefix and is used for government numbers currently only for municipalities the remaining digits represent the area code of the municipality therefore the length 14

same regulation passed on 10 september 2009 regarding landline numbers without the requirement to dial the prefix among numbers with the same geographical area sharing the same prefix the 0 on every prefix is an area code exit code that must be dialed when a number with a different area code is being called so when calling from outside of turkey those 0s are not dialed the dialing format when

these numbers cannot be called from abroad when calling from abroad the initial 0 trunk prefix is not required it is however commonplace to represent telephone numbers with both the international code and the 0 trunk prefix which is typically placed within parentheses but this representation is inconsistent with the e123 international standard14 twentyfour countries and territories share the north american numbering plan nanp with a single country code 1 the formatting convention for telephone numbers is new people's army nxxxxxx where new people's army is the threedigit area code and nxxxxxx is the sevendigit subscriber number15 new people's army has the same syntax of nxx since the implementation of interchangeable area codes in 1995 the prefix nxx of the subscriber number is the central office code unique in the numbering plan area the place holder n stands for the digits 2 to 9 as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1 it is a closed telephone numbering plan in which all subscriber telephone numbers have seven digits in addition to the threedigit area code under allnumber calling a numbering plan introduced around 1960 local calls within an area code were placed by dialing nxxxxxx omitting the area code known as sevendigit dialing only calling a destination in a different area code required dialing the destination area code known as tendigit dialing due to the need for a larger telephone number pool in many regions sevendigit dialing is becoming rare in the united states with the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century many metropolitan areas saw the introduction of additional area codes multiple area codes were assigned to the same numbering plan area a configuration known as an overlay numbering plan calls within an overlay are still local calls despite the need for tendigit dialing in general placing longdistance calls requires dialing the trunk code 1 but this may be optional in some areas canada is a member of the north american numbering plan but administers its numbering resources individually under guidance from the nanp administrator the canadian government has stated on its language portal of canada that telephone numbers are to be written with a hyphen between each sequence as follows 1npanxxxxxx or npanxxxxxx16 10digit dialing is now required throughout most of canada including all of british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitoba quebec nova scotia and prince edward island as well as most of ontario areas not yet requiring 10digit dialing are ontarios 807 area code newfoundland and labrador new brunswick the yukon northwest territories and nunavut although 10digit dialing may be accepted in some of these areas in the province of qubec where french is the first language the office qubcois de la langue franaise has established that telephone numbers must be written with spaces first and then a hyphen for the last sequence as follows 1 new people's army nxxxxxx17 mexican

august 3 2019 all the indicators and access codes 01 044 045 are deprecated therefore all telephone numbers for landline or mobile service are dialed with ten digits18 the formatting convention of a

parentheses instead of using a sign as recommended by e123 for example for a number in costa rica they would write 506 22222222 instead of 506 22222222 on the other hand guatemala does have the custom of using the sign it is quite common for central american businesses to write the whole phone number including the country code in parentheses on business cards signs stationery etc costa rican

the type of service offered there are also short numbers for emergencies such as 911 when costa rica switched from 7 to 8digit numbers it used a scheme similar to the 8digit number scheme already in

calls20 honduran telephone numbers have either seven digits for landlines which are usually written nnnnnnn or eight digits for mobile numbers which are written nnnnnnnn the fact that landline and mobile numbers are different lengths sometimes causes confusion in 2010 an additional digit 2 was added to the start of land line numbers thus standardizing the length at eight digits argentine telephone numbers always consist of 11 digits including the geographical area code the area code can have 3 4 or 5 digits the first being always 0 indicative of longdistance calls moreover in 1999 the whole country except buenos aires and greater buenos aires was divided into two zones roughly and with exceptions one includes most of the northern half of the country and the other most of the southern half though the actual reason for this division is not geographical but the fact that each zone is administered by a different company so the second digit of area codes can be 1 only in buenos aires and greater buenos aires code 011 or else a 2 for towns in the southern half of the country or a 3 for the northern half for example 011 for buenos aires 0341 for rosario 02627 for san rafael and the subscribers number will accordingly have 6 7 or 8 digits to complete the eleven digits phone numbers are mostly written as 011 xxxxxxxx note that only the 011 code has 3 digits 0xxx xxxxxxx or 0xxxx xxxxxx the area code is usually written between brackets in 1999 a general reform was introduced to telephone numbers including the 1 2 and 3 for area codes as explained above and adding a 4 at the beginning of all subscribers numbers however since the reform some local numbers starting with a 5 are beginning to appear moreover a hyphen is usually placed to separate the last four digits code areas do not usually include one single city or town but several neighbouring towns so the part before the hyphen called a prefix is usually indicative of either a town within the code area or even of a part of a larger city which is assigned several prefixes as a matter of fact each area code has only a limited number of prefixes assigned and these are locally limited within the area for example the 0342 area has numbers with a 456 prefix mostly located in the centre of santa fe it also has numbers with a 460 prefix usually for phone lines in the north east of the city and there are lines with a 474 prefix located in santo tom but no 444 prefix exists within this area as for the part after the hyphen it may usually be any succession of four digits though sometimes a prefix is shared by two or more small towns and then the first digit after the hyphen carries the distinction between towns sometimes a prefix is reserved for official numbers that is for offices depending on the national provincial or local state in the 0342 area this is 457 and phones within this prefix communicate with each other by simply dialing the four final digits though from other phones the prefix must be dialled as well mobile phones use the same area codes as landline telephones but the number begins with a 15 added to a string of 6 7 or 8 digits just as described above after the 15 the remainder of the number can start with a 3 a 4 a 5 or a 6 this 15 may be dropped when a call is made to a mobile phone in a different code area and when sending text messages the receivers number is best dialled both without the 15 and with the longdistance code even if both sender and receiver share a code area but without the initial 0 to sum up given the mobile phone 011 (154) 123-4567 you will call it by dialing (154) 123-4567 within the same code area 011 (154) 123-4567 from a different code area including or omitting the 15 and you will send messages to 11 41234567 even when your phone has also a 011 number two sorts of special numbers exist in argentina on the one hand threedigit numbers are used for special services such as to call the police fire brigade or emergency doctors as well as to hear the official time also telephone companies have threedigit numbers to report a problem in the lines or to ask for another subscribers number when a paper directory is not available additionally there are other longer numbers these include but are not limited to 0800 xxx abcd 0810 xxx abcd 0600 xxx abcd where the xxx indicates the same digit dialled three times and a b c and d may each be any of the ten digits 0800 lines are used by companies and it is the receiver and not the caller who pays for the call so that potential clients are encouraged to contact business companies for free 0810 lines are paid by the caller but the cost is for a local call even if you are calling from a different area the remaining is covered by the receiver and 0600 numbers are special more expensive lines that serve such purposes as television games fund collecting for charity companies hot lines etc basically a part of the extra money charged to the caller is sent to the owner of the line often the abcd or even xxxabcd part of the number is chosen if available to form a word that is representative of the company holding the number brazil is divided into 67 twodigit geographical area codes all of which with eightdigit numbers in the format aa nnnnnnnn except for cell phones which contain nine digits usually in the format aa 9nnnnnnnn peru uses 2digit area codes followed by 6digit subscriber numbers outside of lima in lima the area code is 1 and the subscriber number has seven digits divided thirty xxxx the trunk 0 is often used especially for numbers outside lima for example a phone number in arequipa might be written 054 xxxxxx cellphone numbers used to have eight digits with the first digit always being 9 in 2008 an additional digit was added to cellphone numbers while land numbers remained the same the previous convention for cell numbers in lima was usually 9xxx xxxx though 9xxx xxxx was also used with the new 9digit number the form 9xx thirty thirty is becoming increasingly common as opposed to 9 xxxx xxxx 9x thirty xxxx or 9xxxx xxxx outside lima cellphone numbers used to be 9 followed by six digits ie 9 thirty thirty the 2008 changes were somewhat more complicated in four departments similar to states a 2 digit code now has to be entered before the 9 in the example of arequipa the code of 95 has to be entered before the 9 so the new numeration is 959 thirty thirty the other codes are 94 for la libertad trujillo 96 for piura and 97 for lambayeque chiclayo in the other 19 rural departments the 9 is followed by the departments 2digit area code then the 6digit subscriber number for example the area code for cusco is 84 so their new cellphone numeration is 984 thirty thirty the effect is that all peruvian cellphone numbers now have nine digits under the old system they had eight digits in lima and 7 everywhere else21 long distance calling short code karachi and lahore now have eight digit phone numbers in the near future this will be extended to other metros daily times pakistan 20090708 retrieved 20091001 philippines landline telephone numbering plan since 6 october 2019 philippines mobile

language processing news news books scholar jstor may 2024 learn how and when to remove this message natural language processing natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence it is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics typically data is collected in text corpora using either rulebased statistical or neuralbased approaches in machine learning and deep learning major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s1 already in 1950 alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language the premise of symbolic natural language processing is wellsummarized by john searles chinese room experiment given a collection of rules eg a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other natural language processing tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s the georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty russian sentences into english the authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem2 however real progress was much slower and after the alpac report in 1966 which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced little further research in machine translation was conducted in america though some research continued elsewhere such as japan and europe3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were shrdlu a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and eliza a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist written by joseph weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 using almost no information about human thought or emotion eliza sometimes provided a startlingly humanlike interaction when the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base eliza might provide a generic response for example responding to my head hurts with why do you say your head hurts ross quillians successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time4 1970s during the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured realworld information into computerunderstandable data examples are margie schank 1975 surface-to-air missile cullingford 1978 pam wilensky 1978 talespin meehan 1976 scruple lehnert 1977 politics carbonell 1979 and plot units lehnert 1981 during this time the first chatterbots were written eg parry 1980s the 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in natural language processing focus areas of the time included research on rulebased parsing eg the development of hpsg as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology eg twolevel morphology5 semantics eg lesk algorithm reference eg within centering theory6 and other areas of natural language understanding eg in the rhetorical structure theory other lines of research were continued eg the development of chatterbots with racter and jabberwacky an important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period7 up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing8 1990s many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in natural language processing occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research such as ibm alignment models these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government however most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems as a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s with the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data have become available since the mid1990s research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semisupervised learning algorithms such algorithms can learn from data that has not been handannotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and nonannotated data generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data however there is an enormous amount of nonannotated data available including among other things the entire content of the world wide web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical in 2003 word ngram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was outperformed by a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a central processing unit cluster in language modelling by yoshua bengio with coauthors9 in 2010 tom mikolov then a phd student at brno university of technology with coauthors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling10 and in the following years he went on to develop word2vec in the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing that popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques1112 can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling13 and parsing1415 this is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where natural language processing helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care16 or protect patient privacy17 symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by army intelligence in general and by natural language processing in particular1819 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rulebased approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar eg containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input eg with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rulebased systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rulebased systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of llms in 2023 before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods eg for the machine translation of lowresource languages such as provided by the apertium system for preprocessing in natural language processing pipelines eg tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of natural language processing pipelines eg for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses in the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of army intelligence winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches2021 the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since 201522 the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks23 and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore neural machine translation based on thennewlyinvented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below part of a series on key

and apparent comprehension of natural language more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of natural language processing see trends among conll shared tasks above cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses47 cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes48 cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics49 especially during the age of symbolic natural language processing the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing natural language processing algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics50 with two defining aspects apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author51 for example consider the english word big when used in a comparison that is a big tree the authors intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience when used metaphorically tomorrow is a big day the authors intent to imply importance the intent behind other usages like in she is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive natural language processing algorithm alike without additional information assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed eg by means of a probabilistic contextfree grammar pcfg the mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in united states patent 9269353 ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of natural language processing but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar53 functional grammar54 construction grammar55 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg actr however with limited uptake in mainstream natural language processing as measured by presence on major conferences56 of the acl more recently ideas of cognitive natural language processing have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability eg under the notion of cognitive ai57 likewise ideas of cognitive natural language processing are inherent to neural models multimodal natural language processing although rarely made explicit58 and developments in

natural language processing news news books scholar jstor may 2024 learn how and when to remove this message natural language processing natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence it is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics typically data is collected in text corpora using either rulebased statistical or neuralbased approaches in machine learning and deep learning major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification naturallanguage understanding and naturallanguage generation natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s1 already in 1950 alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language the premise of symbolic natural language processing is wellsummarized by john searles chinese room experiment given a collection of rules eg a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other natural language processing tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts 1950s the georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty russian sentences into english the authors claimed that within three or five years machine translation would be a solved problem2 however real progress was much slower and after the alpac report in 1966 which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced little further research in machine translation was conducted in america though some research continued elsewhere such as japan and europe3 until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed 1960s some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were shrdlu a natural language system working in restricted blocks worlds with restricted vocabularies and eliza a simulation of a rogerian psychotherapist written by joseph weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966 using almost no information about human thought or emotion eliza sometimes provided a startlingly humanlike interaction when the patient exceeded the very small knowledge base eliza might provide a generic response for example responding to my head hurts with why do you say your head hurts ross quillians successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words because that was all that would fit in a computer memory at the time4 1970s during the 1970s many programmers began to write conceptual ontologies which structured realworld information into computerunderstandable data examples are margie schank 1975 surface-to-air missile cullingford 1978 pam wilensky 1978 talespin meehan 1976 scruple lehnert 1977 politics carbonell 1979 and plot units lehnert 1981 during this time the first chatterbots were written eg parry 1980s the 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in natural language processing focus areas of the time included research on rulebased parsing eg the development of hpsg as a computational operationalization of generative grammar morphology eg twolevel morphology5 semantics eg lesk algorithm reference eg within centering theory6 and other areas of natural language understanding eg in the rhetorical structure theory other lines of research were continued eg the development of chatterbots with racter and jabberwacky an important development that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period7 up until the 1980s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules starting in the late 1980s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics eg transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing8 1990s many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in natural language processing occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research such as ibm alignment models these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government however most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems which was and often continues to be a major limitation in the success of these systems as a result a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data 2000s with the growth of the web increasing amounts of raw unannotated language data have become available since the mid1990s research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semisupervised learning algorithms such algorithms can learn from data that has not been handannotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and nonannotated data generally this task is much more difficult than supervised learning and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data however there is an enormous amount of nonannotated data available including among other things the entire content of the world wide web which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical in 2003 word ngram model at the time the best statistical algorithm was outperformed by a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a central processing unit cluster in language modelling by yoshua bengio with coauthors9 in 2010 tom mikolov then a phd student at brno university of technology with coauthors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling10 and in the following years he went on to develop word2vec in the 2010s representation learning and deep neural networkstyle featuring many hidden layers machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing that popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques1112 can achieve stateoftheart results in many natural language tasks eg in language modeling13 and parsing1415 this is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare where natural language processing helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care16 or protect patient privacy17 symbolic approach ie the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by army intelligence in general and by natural language processing in particular1819 such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts whereas the rulebased approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally language models produced by either statistical or neural networks methods are more robust to both unfamiliar eg containing words or structures that have not been seen before and erroneous input eg with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted in comparison to the rulebased systems which are also more costly to produce the larger such a probabilistic language model is the more accurate it becomes in contrast to rulebased systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems although rulebased systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020 they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of llms in 2023 before that they were commonly used when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods eg for the machine translation of lowresource languages such as provided by the apertium system for preprocessing in natural language processing pipelines eg tokenization or for postprocessing and transforming the output of natural language processing pipelines eg for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses in the late 1980s and mid1990s the statistical approach ended a period of army intelligence winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches2021 the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering since 201522 the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks23 and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words intermediate tasks eg partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore neural machine translation based on thennewlyinvented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience a coarse division is given below part of a series on key

supervised towards weakly supervised methods representation learning and endtoend systems most higherlevel natural language processing applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of natural language processing see trends among conll shared tasks above cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses47 cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes48 cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics49 especially during the age of symbolic natural language processing the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing natural language processing algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics50 with two defining aspects apply the theory of conceptual metaphor explained by lakoff as the understanding of one idea in terms of another which provides an idea of the intent of the author51 for example consider the english word big when used in a comparison that is a big tree the authors intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience when used metaphorically tomorrow is a big day the authors intent to imply importance the intent behind other usages like in she is a big person will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive natural language processing algorithm alike without additional information assign relative measures of meaning to a word phrase sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed eg by means of a probabilistic contextfree grammar pcfg the mathematical equation for such algorithms is presented in united states patent 9269353 ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of natural language processing but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks eg of cognitive grammar53 functional grammar54 construction grammar55 computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience eg actr however with limited uptake in mainstream natural language processing as measured by presence on major conferences56 of the acl more recently ideas of cognitive natural language processing have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability eg under the notion of cognitive ai57 likewise ideas of cognitive natural language processing are inherent to neural models multimodal natural language processing although rarely made explicit58 and developments in

the case in corpus linguistics the creation and use of such corpora of realworld data is a fundamental part of machinelearning algorithms for natural language processing in addition theoretical underpinnings of chomskyan linguistics such as the socalled poverty of the stimulus argument entail that general learning algorithms as are typically used in machine learning cannot be successful in

portal vte v t e computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the computational modelling of natural language as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions in general computational linguistics draws upon linguistics computer science artificial intelligence mathematics logic philosophy cognitive science cognitive psychology psycholinguistics anthropology and neuroscience among others the field overlapped with artificial intelligence since the efforts in the united states in the 1950s to use computers to automatically translate texts from foreign languages particularly russian scientific journals into english1 since rulebased approaches were able to make arithmetic systematic calculations much faster and more accurately than humans it was expected that lexicon morphology syntax and semantics can be learned using explicit rules as well after the failure of rulebased approaches david hays2 coined the term in order to distinguish the field from army intelligence and cofounded both the association for computational linguistics acl and the international committee on computational linguistics iccl in the 1970s and 1980s what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into a much wider field of natural language processing34 in order to be able to meticulously study the english language an annotated text corpus was much needed the penn treebank5 was one of the most used corpora it consisted of ibm computer manuals transcribed telephone conversations and other texts together containing over 45 million words of american english annotated using both partofspeech tagging and syntactic bracketing6 japanese sentence corpora were analyzed and a pattern of lognormality was found in relation to sentence length7 the fact that during language acquisition children are largely only exposed to positive evidence8 meaning that the only evidence for what is a correct form is provided and no evidence for what is not correct9 was a limitation for the models at the time because the now available deep learning models were not available in late 1980s10 it has been shown that languages can be learned with a combination of simple input presented incrementally as the child develops better memory and longer attention span11 which explained the long period of language acquisition in human infants and children11 robots have been used to test linguistic theories12 enabled to learn as children might models were created based on an affordance model in which mappings between actions perceptions and effects were created and linked to spoken words crucially these robots were able to acquire functioning wordtomeaning mappings without needing grammatical structure using the price equation and plya urn dynamics researchers have created a system which not only predicts future linguistic evolution but also gives insight into the evolutionary history of modernday languages13 chomskys theories have influenced computational linguistics particularly in understanding how infants learn complex grammatical structures such as those described in chomsky normal form14 attempts have been made to determine how an infant learns a nonnormal grammar as theorized by chomsky normal form9 research in this area combines structural approaches with computational models to analyze large linguistic corpora like the penn treebank helping to uncover patterns in language acquisition15 philosophy portal artificial intelligence in fiction collostructional analysis computational

history timeline progress army intelligence winter army intelligence boom timeline progress army intelligence winter army intelligence boom glossary glossary glossary vte v t e machine learning milliliter is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions1 quick progress in the field of deep learning beginning in 2010s allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance2 milliliter finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine34 the application of milliliter to business problems is known as predictive analytics statistics and mathematical optimization mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis eda via unsupervised learning67 from a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct political action committee learning provides a framework for describing machine learning the term machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence89 the synonym selfteaching computers was also used in this time period1011 although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when arthur samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes12 in 1949 canadian psychologist donald hebb published the book the organization of behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells13 hebbs model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how ais and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data12 other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician walter pitts and warren mcculloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes12 by the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called cybertron had been developed by raytheon company to analyze sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning it was repetitively trained by a human operatorteacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions14 a representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was nilssons book on learning machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification15 interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by duda and hart in 197316 in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal17 tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e18 this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turings proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do19 modernday machine learning has two objectives one is to classify data based on models which have been developed the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models a hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions20 as a scientific endeavor machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence army intelligence in the early days of army intelligence as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics22 probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis23 488 however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledgebased approach caused a rift between army intelligence and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation23 488 by 1980 expert systems had come to dominate army intelligence and statistics was out of favor24 work on symbolicknowledgebased learning did continue within army intelligence leading to inductive logic programmingilp but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of army intelligence proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval23 708710 755 neural networks research had been abandoned by army intelligence and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the aics field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield rumelhart and hinton their main success came in the mid1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation23 25 machine learning milliliter reorganized and recognized as its own field started to flourish in the 1990s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from army intelligence and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory24 there is a close connection between machine learning and compression a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history this equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence252627 an alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors and compressionbased similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces for each compressor c we define an associated vector space such that c maps an input string x corresponding to the vector norm x an exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space instead feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods lzw lz77 and ppm28 according to aixi theory a connection more directly explained in hutter prize the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x for example in that model a zip files compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software since you can not unzip it without both but there may be an even smaller combined form examples of aipowered audiovideo compression software include nvidia maxine aivc29 examples of software that can perform aipowered image compression include opencv tensorflow matlabs image processing toolbox ipt and highfidelity generative image compression30 in unsupervised machine learning kmeans clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters this technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression31 data compression aims to reduce the size of data files enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission kmeans clustering an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters k each represented by the centroid of its points this process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points particularly beneficial in image and signal processing kmeans clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space32 machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples34 characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns35 according to michael i jordan the ideas of machine learning from methodological principles to theoretical tools have had a long prehistory in statistics36 he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field36 conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set in addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis in contrast machine learning is not built on a prestructured model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns the more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be37 leo breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms data model and algorithmic model38 wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning39 analytical and computational techniques derived from deeprooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to largescale problems including machine learning eg to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks40 statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics41 a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience542 generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning political action committee model because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error for the best performance in the context of generalization the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has under fitted the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer43 in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent as it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback thats analogous to rewards which it tries to maximize5 although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems444546 supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs47 the data known as training data consists of a set of training examples each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix through iterative optimization of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs48 an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task18 types of supervisedlearning algorithms include active learning classification and regression49 classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range as an example for a classification algorithm that filters emails the input would be an incoming email and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person or the future temperature 50 similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are it has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled classified or categorized instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction7 and density estimation51 unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pangenome52 cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity a special type of unsupervised learning called selfsupervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself5455 semisupervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labeled training data and supervised learning with completely labeled training data some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machinelearning researchers have found that unlabeled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy in weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets56 reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulationbased optimization multiagent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques57 reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables58 in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca pca involves changing higherdimensional data eg three-d to a smaller space eg second the manifold hypothesis proposes that highdimensional data sets lie along lowdimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this threefold categorization and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system for example topic modeling metalearning59 selflearning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of selflearning named crossbar adaptive array caa60 it is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice the caa selflearning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion61 the selflearning algorithm updates a memory matrix w was such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s compute emotion of being in the consequence situation vs update crossbar memory was was vs it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behavior a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioral environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goalseeking behavior in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations62 several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training63 classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a preprocessing step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown datagenerating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned using labeled input data examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabeled input data examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorization64 and various forms of clustering656667 manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is lowdimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn lowdimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higherdimensional vectors68 deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higherlevel more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lowerlevel features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data69 feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however realworld data such as images video and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix the method is strongly nphard and difficult to solve approximately70 a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the ksvd algorithm sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot71 in data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data72 typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions73 in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts of inactivity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the microclusters formed by these patterns74 three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist75 unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection semisupervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning7677 and finally metalearning eg maml association rule learning is a rulebased machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness78 rulebased machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge the defining characteristic of a rulebased machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction79 rulebased machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal tomasz imieliski and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in largescale transaction data recorded by pointofsale polonium systems in supermarkets80 for example the rule o n i o n s p o t a t o e s b u r g e r displaystyle mathrm onionspotatoes rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements in addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics in contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions learning classifier systems lcs are a family of rulebased machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning they seek to identify a set of contextdependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions81 inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting828384 shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in 1981 a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples85 the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a wellordered set a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that after being trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data during training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the models internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions86 by extension the term model can refer to several levels of specificity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned87 various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition88 decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves it is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making in data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decisionmaking supportvector machines svms also known as supportvector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category89 an svm training algorithm is a nonprobabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a nonlinear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into highdimensional feature spaces regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with nonlinear problems goto models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel90 logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces nonlinearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higherdimensional space a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dekagram for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a predefined covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations given a set of observed points or inputoutput examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization a genetic algorithm tabun is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s9293 conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms94 the theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or dempstershafer theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability possibility and imprecise probability theories these theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined eg dempsters rule of combination just like how in a pmfbased bayesian approachclarification needed would combine probabilities however there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification these belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learners decision boundary low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving49 however the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions when training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model trained models derived from biased or nonevaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions biased models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server this also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices for example gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on

the first netflix prize competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10 a joint team made up of researchers from att labsresearch in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in 2009 for 1 million98 shortly after the prize was awarded netflix realized that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly99 in 2010 the wall street journal wrote about the firm rebellion research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis100 in 2012 cofounder of sun microsystems vinod khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software101 in 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists102 in 2019 springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning103 in 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for covid19104 machine learning was recently applied to predict the proenvironmental behavior of travelers105 recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphones performance and thermal behavior based on the users interaction with the phone106107108 when applied correctly machine learning algorithms mlas can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting by employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts mlas can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like ols109 recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes110 machine learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes111112113 other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires114115 although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machinelearning programs often fail to deliver expected results116117118 reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems119 the black box theory poses another yet significant challenge black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data120 the house of lords select committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individuals life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes120 in 2018 a selfdriving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision121 attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested122123 microsofts bing chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users124 machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves125 different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data when trained on humanmade data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society126 language models learned from data have been shown to contain humanlike biases127128 in an experiment carried out by propublica an investigative journalism organization a machine learning algorithms insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants129 in 2015 google photos would often tag black people as gorillas129 and in 2018 this still was not well resolved but google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all130 similar issues with recognizing nonwhite people have been found in many other systems131 in 2016 microsoft tested tay a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language132 because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains133 concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including feifei li who reminds engineers that theres nothing artificial about army intelligence its inspired by people its created by people andmost importantlyit impacts people it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility134 explainable army intelligence xai or interpretable army intelligence or explainable machine learning xml is artificial intelligence army intelligence in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai135 it contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an army intelligence arrived at a specific decision136 by refining the mental models of users of aipowered systems and dismantling their misconceptions xai promises to help users perform more effectively xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is137 learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses138 a realworld example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies139140 adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from nonpattern perturbations for some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel141 machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation andor evasion via adversarial machine learning142 researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying eg for categories spam and wellvisible not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed andor trained by third parties parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided possibly including whitebox access143144145 classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data in a training and test set conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the kfoldcrossvalidation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k1 subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and crossvalidation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy146 in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators the total operating characteristic toc is an effective method to express a models diagnostic ability toc shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic roc and rocs associated area under the curve auc147 machine learning poses a host of ethical questions systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitizing cultural prejudices148 for example in 1988 the uks commission for racial equality found that st georges medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have noneuropean sounding names126 using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants149150 another example includes predictive policing company geoliticas predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of overpolicing in lowincome and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data129 while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of army intelligence for machine learnings vulnerability to biases151 in fact according to research carried out by the computing research association cra in 2021 female faculty merely make up 161 of all faculty members who focus on army intelligence among several universities around the world152 furthermore among the group of new united states resident army intelligence phd graduates 45 identified as white 224 as asian 32 as hispanic and 24 as african american which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai152 army intelligence can be wellequipped to make decisions in technical fields which rely heavily on data and historical information these decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning153 because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases154155 other forms of ethical challenges not related to personal biases are seen in health care there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the publics interest but as incomegenerating machines156 this is especially true in the united states where there is a longstanding ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithms proprietary owners hold stakes there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated157 since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units158 by 2019 graphic processing units gpus often with aispecific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training largescale commercial cloud ai159 openai estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet 2012 to alphazero 2017 and found a 300000fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doublingtime trendline of 34 months160161 a physical neural network or neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse physical neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to softwarebased approaches more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse162163 embedded machine learning is a subfield of machine learning where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers164165166 running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing henceforth reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties personal data and business secrets embedded machine learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration167168 using approximate computing169 optimization of machine learning models and many more170171 pruning quantization knowledge distillation lowrank factorization network architecture search sodium parameter sharing are few of the techniques used for optimization of machine learning models software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following

platform offer that opportunity154 a 2016 study reported that teenage girls manipulate their selfpresentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers155 teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance likes comments and shares when this does not go well selfconfidence and selfsatisfaction can decline155 a 2018 survey of american teens ages 1317 by common sense media reported that 45 said likes are at least somewhat important and 26 at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos144 some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain156 and some may resort to online bullying157 according to a 2016 study users reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers158 a 2016 review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos selfcomparison disappointment and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved159 one 2016 study reported that pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior160 people portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way155 however upon seeing one persons curated persona other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling one 2017 study reported that problematic social media use ie feeling addicted to social media was related to lower life satisfaction and selfesteem161 studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health162163 in one study women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction while men reported them as the second biggest factor164 while monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with ones own may increase their impact a 2021 study reported that 87 of women and 65 of men compared themselves to others on social media165 efforts to combat such negative effects focused promoting body positivity in a related study women aged 1830 were reported posts that contained sidebyside images of women in the same clothes and setting but one image was enhanced for instagram while the other was an unedited realistic version women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction166 social media can offer a support system for adolescent health because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant167 for example in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoing obesity treatment participants claimed that social media allowed them to access personalized weightloss content as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity168169 while social media can provide health information it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information169 the national eating disorders association reported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content169170 health literacy offers skills to allow users to spotavoid such content efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success171 social media such as proanorexia sites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging healthrelated behaviors through social media especially among adolescents172173174 during the coronavirus pandemic inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media175 topics subject to distortion included treatments avoiding infection vaccination and public policy simultaneously governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy176 heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories leading to worse mental health177 and less compliance with public health recommendations178 social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addictionrelated behaviors with studies report that excessive use can lead to addictionlike symptoms these symptoms include compulsive checking mood modification and withdrawal when not using social media which can result in decreased facetoface social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness179 a 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media it concluded that blue light from computerphone displaysand the frequency rather than the duration of time spent predicted disturbed sleep termed obsessive checking183 the association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults184 a recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance the median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61 females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance185 many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones and this left them tired and unfocused in school186 a 2011 study reported that time spent on facebook was negatively associated with grade point average but the association with sleep disturbance was not established187 one studied effect of social media is facebook depression which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media8 this may lead to reclusiveness which can increase loneliness and low selfesteem8 social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling184 studies report childrens selfesteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments this affected selfperception188 a 2017 study of almost 6000 adolescent students reported that those who selfreported addictionlike symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low selfesteem and high levels of depressive symptoms189 a second emotional effect is social media burnout defined as ambivalence emotional exhaustion and depersonalization ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media the three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media190 a third emotional effect is fear of missing out fomo which is the pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent191 it is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media191 social media can also offer support as twitter has done for the medical community192 x facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes comments and posts193 access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones194 some commentators refer to social media as antisocial media when describing its social impact195196 the digital divide is the unequal access to digital technology including smartphones tablets laptops and the internet197198 the digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources in the information age people without access to the internet and other technology are at a disadvantage for they are unable or less able to connect with others find and apply for jobs shop and learn197199 many critics point to studies showing social media algorithms elevate more partisan and inflammatory content204205 because of recommendation algorithms that filter and display news content that matches users political preferences one potential impact is an increase in political polarization due to selective exposure political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towards ideological extremes selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them206 aviv ovadya argues that these algorithms incentivize the creation of divisive content in addition to promoting existing divisive content207 but could be designed to reduce polarization instead208 in 2017 facebook gave its new emoji reactions five times the weight in its algorithms as its like button which data scientists at the company in 2019 confirmed had disproportionately boosted toxicity misinformation and lowquality news209 some popular ideas for how to combat selective exposure have had no or opposite impacts210211207 some advocate for media literacy as a solution212 others argue that less social media206 or more local journalism213214215 could help address political polarization a 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes216 stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations for example during the covid19 pandemic youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease217 elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media218 social media allows for mass cultural exchange and intercultural communication despite different ways of communicating in various cultures219 social media has affected the way youth communicate by introducing new forms of language220 novel acronyms save time as illustrated by lol which is the ubiquitous shortcut for laugh out loud the hashtag was created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement mark content for future use and allow other users to contribute to a discussion221 for some young people social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications made worse by pandemic isolation delaying the development of conversation and other social skills222 what is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media223 the american academy of pediatrics reported that bullying the making of noninclusive friend groups and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying privacy issues and sending sexual images or messages sexting and revenge porn became rampant particularly among minors with legal implications and resulting trauma risk224225226227 however adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online228 social media can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch making more friends and engaging in community activities8 this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it july 2024 in july 2014 in response to wikileaks release of a secret suppression order made by the victorian supreme court media lawyers were quoted in the australian media to the effect that anyone who tweets a link to the wikileaks report posts it on facebook or shares it in any way online could also face charges229 on 27 july 2020 in egypt two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for posting tiktok videos which the government claimed as violating family values230 in the 2014 thai coup dtat the public was explicitly instructed not to share or like dissenting views on social media or face prisoncitation needed historically platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented they set rules for what was allowable decided which content to promote and which to ignore the united states enacted the communications decency act in 1996 section 230 of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider 47 usc 230c1 in 2024 legislation was enacted in florida requiring social media companies to verify the age of people with accounts and to prohibit holding an account for people aged under 14 and between 14 and 16 in the absence of parental approval231232 the european union initially took a similar approach233 however in 2020 the european commission presented two legislative proposals the digital services act dsa and the digital markets act dma both proposals were enacted in july 2022 the dsa entered into force on 17 february 2024 the dma in march 2024234 this legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives articulated by meps what is illegal offline must also be illegal online235 very large online platforms must therefore among other things delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the european commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 delete illegal content propaganda election interference hate crimes and online harms such as harassment and child abuse and better protect fundamental rights redesign their systems to ensure a high level of privacy security and protection of minors by prohibiting advertising based on personal data designing recommender systems to minimize risks for children and demonstrating this to the european commission via a risk assessment and not use sensitive personal data such as race gender and religion to target advertising236 violators could face a complete ban in europe or fines of up to 6 of global sales such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers237 enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance238 the dsa allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction according to patrick breyer from the german pirate party a problem could arise from the hungarian government requesting a video to be deleted that is critical of victor orban as he foresaw the potential for such determinations to be applied euwide239 2018 nobel laureate paul romer240 advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms237 similar to a carbon tax negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms241 assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities the revenue raised could be used to address them however consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms nor to craft a tax another proposal is to invoke competition law242 the idea is to restrict the platforms market power by controlling mergers ex ante and tightening the law this would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines in a 2024 opinion piece megan moreno and jenny radesky professors of pediatrics wrote about the need for nuanced policy243 they regarded access which is contingent upon parental consent as harmful they commented that a focus on increasing age restrictions may serve to distract from making sure platforms are following guidelines and best practices for all ages244 in june 2024 united states surgeon general vivek murthy called for social media platforms to contain a warning about the impact they have on the mental health of young people245 the business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers platforms provide access to data about each user which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them this strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible increasing the number of ads that they see platforms such as x add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues246 the enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism debate and controversy criticisms include platform capabilities content moderation and reliability247 impact on concentration mental health248 content ownership and the meaning of interactions and poor crossplatform interoperability249 decrease in facetoface interactions cyberbullying sexual predation particularly of children and child pornography250251 in 2007 andrew keen wrote out of this anarchy it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the internet was the law of digital darwinism the survival of the loudest and most opinionated under these rules the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering252 social media has become a regular source of news and information a 2021 pew research center poll reported roughly 70 of users regularly get news from social media4 despite the presence of fake news and misinformation platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy and many do not vet content at all although in some cases content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced253254255 content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance responding instead to the contents virality in 2018 researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70 faster than truthful news on x7 social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users10 some platforms attempt to discover and block bots with limited success11 fake news seems to receive more user engagement possibly because it is relatively novel engaging users curiosity and increasing spread23 fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event before conventional media are prepared to publish2016 social media mining is the process of obtaining data from usergenerated content on social media in order to extract actionable patterns form conclusions about users and act upon the information mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research the term is an analogy to the process of mining for minerals mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals likewise social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage online behaviour content sharing connections between individuals buying behaviour these patterns and trends are of interest to companies governments and notforprofit organizations as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies introduce programs products processes or services social media mining uses concepts from computer science data mining machine learning and statistics mining is based on social network analysis network science sociology ethnography optimization and mathematics it attempts to formally represent measure and model patterns from social media data256 in the 2010s major corporations governments and notforprofit organizations began mining to learn about customers clients and others platforms such as google facebook partnered with datalogix and bluekai conduct mining to target users with advertising257 scientists and machine learning researchers extract insights and design product features258 users may not understand how platforms use their data259 users tend to click through terms of use agreements without reading them leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users privacy malcolm gladwell considers the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated he concluded that while social media makes it easier for activists to express themselves that expression likely has no impact beyond social media what he called highrisk activism involves strong relationships coordination commitment high risks and sacrifice261 gladwell claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that social networks are effective at increasing participationby lessening the level of motivation that participation requires261 according to him facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice261 disputing gladwells theory a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity262 social media content is generated by users however content ownership is defined by the terms of service to which users agree platforms control access to the content and may make it available to third parties263 although platforms terms differ generally they all give permission to utilize users copyrighted works at the platforms discretion264 after its acquisition by facebook in 2012 instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users265266 it then reversed these changes with thenceo kevin systrom promising to update the terms of service267268 privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data information is captured without the users knowing consent data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes269263 information may be offered for third party use young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators270 while social media users claim to want to keep their data private their behavior does not reflect that concern as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles in addition platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles this data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising271 a 2014 pew research center survey reported that 91 of americans agree or strongly agree that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used some 80 of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms and 64 said the government should do more to regulate advertisers272 in 2019 united kingdom legislators criticized facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data273 in 2019 the pentagon issued guidance to the military coast guard and other government agencies that identified the potential risk associated with using the tiktok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information274 as a result the military coast guard transportation security administration and department of homeland security banned the installation and use of tiktok on government devices275 in 2020 the united states government attempted to ban tiktok and wechat from the states over national security concerns however a federal court blocked the move276 in 2024 the united states congress passed a low directing tiktoks parent company bytedance to divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the united states the company sued challenging the constitutionality of the ban277 internet addiction disorder iad also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use is a problematic compulsive use of the internet particularly on social media that impairs an individuals function over a prolonged period of time young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder278 with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online279 some experience health consequences from loss of sleep280 as they stay up to continue scrolling chatting and gaming281 excessive internet use is not recognized as a disorder by the world health organization the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm5 or the international classification of diseases icd11282 however gaming disorder appears in the icd11283 controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders definitions are not standardized or agreed upon complicating the development of evidencebased recommendations users under 30 access the internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse284 in 2011 the term facebook addiction disorder fad emerged285 fad is characterized by compulsive use of facebook a 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use and narcissism reporting fad was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables depression anxiety and stress symptoms286287 in 2020 the documentary the social dilemma reported concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social medias pursuit of addictive use for example when a user has not visited facebook for some time the platform varies its notifications attempting to lure them back it also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality288 whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous291 a study of americans aged 1215 reported that teenagers who used social media over three hoursday doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety292 platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content a 2023 study of australian youth reported that 57 had seen disturbingly violent content while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images293 further youth are prone to misuse social media for cyberbullyingcitation needed as result phones have been banned from some schools and some schools in the united states have blocked social media websites294 social media often features in political struggles in some countries internet police or secret police monitor or control citizens use of social media for example in 2013 some social media was banned in turkey after the taksim gezi park protests both x and youtube were temporarily suspended in the country by a courts decision a law granted immunity to telecommunications directorate terbium personnel the terbium was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order295 yet tbs 2014 blocking of x was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech296 internet censorship in the united states is the suppression of information published or viewed on the internet in the united states the first amendment of the united states constitution protects freedom of speech and expression against federal state and local government censorship free speech protections allow little governmentmandated internet content restrictions however the internet is highly regulated supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms297 gambling cyber security and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the us297 many governmentmandated attempts to regulate content have been barred often after lengthy legal battles298 however the government has exerted pressure indirectly with the exception of child pornography content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to removesuppress content following state encouragement or the threat of legal action299297 while the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable open source protocols such as activitypub have been adopted by platforms such as mastodon gnu social diaspora and friendica they operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteeroperated servers called the fediverse however in 2019 mastodon blocked gab from connecting to it claiming that it spread violent rightwing extremism305 in december 2019 x chief executive officer jack dorsey advocated an open and decentralized standard for social media he joined bluesky to bring it to reality306 deplatforming also called noplatforming is a form of internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their informationideas this typically involves suspension outright bans or reducing spread shadow banning307308 a number of commentators and experts have argued that social media companies have incentives that to maximize user engagement with sensational emotive and controversial material that discourages a healthy discourse that democracies depend on311 zack beauchamp of vox calls it an authoritarian medium because of how it is incentivized to stir up hate and division that benefits aspiring autocrats312 the economist describes social media as vulnerable to manipulation by autocrats313 informed dialogue a shared sense of reality mutual consent and participation can all suffer due to the business model of social media314 political polarization can be one byproduct315316317 this has implications for the likelihood of political violence318206 siva vaidhyanathan argues for a range of solutions including privacy protections and enforcing antitrust laws195 andrew leonard describes polis as one possible solution to the divisiveness of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus319320 according to likewar the weaponization of social media321 the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities corporations and governments but also extremist groups322 the use of social media by isis and alqaeda has been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers social media platforms and encryptedmessaging applications have been used to recruit members both locally and internationally323 platforms have endured backlash for allowing this content extreme nationalist groups and more prominently united states rightwing extremists have used similar online tactics as many traditional social media platforms banned hate speech several platforms became popular among rightwing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events these application became known as alttech platforms such as telegram parler and gab were used during the january 6 united states capitol attack to coordinate attacks324 members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians325 social media content persists unless the user deletes it after a user dies unless the platform is notified their content remains326 each platform has created guidelines for this situation327 in most cases on social media the platforms require a nextofkin to prove that the user is deceased and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a legacy status x328 the company works with an immediate family member to deactivate the account additionally x will not give the account to any other person regardless of the relationship facebook users have the option of having their account permanently deleted after death users can identify a legacy contact who would take over the account after instagram329 users can have the account memorialized or deleted

extended to four digits in many areas due to the increased number of telephone users in the international context 82 0xxxxxxxxx is commonly used as well for international calls 0 in the area code is often omitted because it is not necessary to dial 0 from foreign countries therefore it is better written as 820xxxxxxxxx or 820xxxxxxxxxx the plus sign is often added to the country code eg 82 0xxxxxxxxx or 820xxxxxxxxxx for mobile numbers 016490641 so on as with the landline home numbers the mobile numbers middle threedigit part is extended to four digits eg 016490641 due to the increased number of mobile phone users if a number starts with 070 the number does not belong to any particular area and is a number given by an internet telephone service in this case 070 is not usually put in the brackets neither nor in the business context the numbers in the format of 15xxxxxx and 16xxxxxx are business representative agency or customer services while the numbers starting with 080 eg 080xxxxxxx are also businessrelated numbers but are usually tollfree customer service centers also in this case 15xx 16xx or 070 are not put in the brackets neither nor there are national telephone services which have phone numbers in the format of 1xx or 1xxx without any area code for example 114 is for telephone yellow page 119 is for fireemergency number 112 is for police station center 131 is for weather forecast information 1333 is for traffic information and so on the number 111 is for reporting spies especially from north korea it used to be 113 so most of senior citizen still believe it is the number for reporting spies these numbers do not need any brackets if there are multiple numbers used for one personentity the symbol is usually used to avoid repetitions for example if one company has three phone numbers0311111111 (031) 111-1112 and 0311111113then they are shortened as in 03111111113 if the numbers are not consecutive then the last digit is written together with commas for example if a company has three numbers0311111111 (031) 111-1115 (031) 111-1119 then they are shortened as in (031) 111-1111 5 9 landline numbers in taiwan are written with the area code in

bbbbbb e123 local 0aaaa bbbbbb e123 international 49 aaaa bbbbbb microsoft 49 aaaa bbbbbb old 0aaaabbbbbb very old 0aaaabbbbbbxx numbers are often written in blocks of two example 49 a aa b bb bb note the blocks go from right to left the very old format and e123 local form are still in use sometimes for technical reasons greek telephone numbers have ten digits and usually written aab bbbbbbb or aaab bbbbbb where aab or aaab is the 2 or 3digit national area code plus the first digit of the subscriber number and bbbbbbb or bbbbbb are the remaining digits of the subscriber number the entire number must always be dialed even if calling within the same local area therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number according to international convention numbers are sometimes written 30 aab bbbbbbb or 30 aaab bbbbbb to include the country calling code in hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two except for budapest the capital which has the area code 1 subscribers numbers have six digits in general numbers in budapest and cell phone numbers have seven digits phone numbers in iceland have seven digits and generally written in the form thirty xxxx or xxxxxxx phone numbers in ireland are part of an open numbering plan with varying number lengths the area code system is similar to that in some other northern european countries unlike the united kingdom irish fixed line numbering is divided into a number of regions which are except dublin further subdivided in a hierarchical structure with the largest town often but not always taking 0a1 area codes start with a trunk prefix 0 and extend for up to four digits but usually 3 followed by the local phone number of up to seven digits in industry jargon these area codes and prefixes are referred to as ndcs national dialing codes this is the term used by comreg and technical documents as they include nongeographic codes historically like the united kingdom the term venereal disease code subscriber trunk dialling was used however the terminology is archaic and is no longer universally understood and should not be used to avoid confusion dublin uses the shorter 01 code which is not further subdivided other cities and major towns usually have codes ending in 1 cork for example is 021 galway 091 limerick 061 etc the leading zero is always omitted when dialling from outside the country local phone numbers have either 5 6 or 7digits in 7digit numbering they are usually grouped as bbb bbbb 6digit numbers are grouped bbb bbb and 5digit numbers are normally all grouped together bbbbb grouping of numbers is not strictly adhered to but usually fairly consistent the area code should always be kept separated with a space or surrounded by brackets and not merged into the local number the use of hyphens is discouraged particularly on websites as it can prevent mobile browsers identifying the number as a clickable link for easier dialling fixed line numbers are normally presented as follows 01 bbb bbbb for a dublin number 7 digit 021 bbb bbbb for a cork number 7 digit 064 bbb bbbb for a killarney number 7 digit 061 bbb bbb for a limerick number 6 digit 098 bbbbb for a westport number 5 digit 0404 bbbbb for a wicklow number 5 digit area codes may also be surrounded by brackets but this practice is falling out of use as local dialing without the area code is optional on landlines and the area code must always be dialled on mobile phones the irish telecommunication regulator comreg has been gradually rationalising area codes by merging and extending local numbering to 7digits in the format 0aa bbb bbbb this is being carried out only where necessary to avoid disruption this means that varying fixed line number lengths will continue to exist in ireland for the foreseeable future mobile numbers are presented as follows 08a bbb bbbb brackets should not be used around the mobile prefix as it is never optional and must always be dialled even from another phone with the same prefix special rate numbers such as free phonetoll free and premium rate are usually grouped freephone 1800 bb bb bb or spoken as oneeighthundred local rate 1850 bb bb bb eighteenfifty 1550 bb bb bb read as fifteenfifty however for memorability this is not consistently adhered to alphanumeric characters can also be used in presenting numbers for added memorability but it is much less common than in north america for example 18aa 99 cab note these special rate numbers are not reachable from outside ireland7 phone numbers in italy have variable length theres no well established convention about how to group digits or which symbol to use but this is hardly an issue since all the digits are always dialed since 10 october 1995 operation decibel all telephone numbers in the netherlands have ten digits including the trunk prefix 0 the area code a is commonly separated with a dash and sometimes a space from the subscribers number b alternatively the area code including the trunk prefix can be enclosed in parentheses the length of the area code for landlines is either 2 or 3 digits depending on the population density of the area this leaves 7 or 6 digits for the subscribers number resulting in a format of either 0aabbbbbbb or 0aaabbbbbb cellphone numbers are assigned the 1digit area code 6 leaving eight digits for the subscribers number 06cbbbbbbb where subscribers number c is neither 6 nor 7 service numbers area codes 800 900 906 and 909 have either 4 or 7 remaining digits making them 8 or 11 digits in total 0aaabbbb or 0aaabbbbbbb the area code 14 has no trunk prefix and is used for government numbers currently only for municipalities the remaining digits represent the area code of the municipality therefore the length 14 numbers total either 5 or 6 digits 14 0aa or 14 0aaa the trunk prefix 0 is dropped when prefixed by the country code 31 aa bbbbbbbb 31 6 cbbbbbbb etcetera note that there is not a trunk prefix for the 14 series so the international number becomes 31 14 0aaa norwegian telephone numbers have eight digits a number to a fixed line is written in four groups of two separated by spaces aa aa aa aa phone

province that group might be of 2 or 3 digits for example 91 and 81 are for madrid while 925 and 825 are for toledo the second group is always of 3 digits as it formerly identified the telephone exchange it now identifies the telephone area when the first group has two digits as in madrid the number is usually written in four groups of 2322 digits bachelor of arts three hundred doctor of

always be dialed including the leading 0 even if calling within a local area therefore the national destination code is not separated from the subscriber number according to international convention numbers are sometimes written 41 aa bbb bb bb to include the country calling code certain nationwide destination codes such as for tollfree or premiumrate telephone numbers are written 0800 bbb bbb or

abdominal aortic aneurysm aa aa and turk telekom has the prefix 055b abdominal aortic aneurysm aa aa since 9 november 2008 with the passing of the number carriability regulation by icta mobile numbers can be carried from one mobile carrier to the other without having to change the prefix10 this caused dialing 05bb to call another number on the same carrier to become mandatory calls to numbers which were carried to another operator are signaled by a unique sound upon dialing to signify that the recipient is on another network and alert them against potentially unwanted interconnection charges the same regulation passed on 10 september 2009 regarding landline numbers without the requirement to dial the prefix among numbers with the same geographical area sharing the same prefix the 0 on every prefix is an area code exit code that must be dialed when a number with a different area code is being called so when calling from outside of turkey those 0s are not dialed the dialing format when calling from outside turkey is 90 bbb abdominal aortic aneurysm aa aa and not 90 0bbb abdominal aortic aneurysm aa aa unlike the north american system the country exit code isnt 011 but 00 so it is

service numbers such as 100 for the operator 123 for the speaking clock and 155 for the international operator as well as 118 abdominal aortic aneurysm for various directory enquiry services and 116 abdominal aortic aneurysm for various helplines for some services the number you call will depend on which operator you use to connect the call 112 and 999 work for calling the emergency services these numbers cannot be called from abroad when calling from abroad the initial 0 trunk prefix is not required it is however commonplace to represent telephone numbers with both the international code and the 0 trunk prefix which is typically placed within parentheses but this representation is inconsistent with the e123 international standard14 twentyfour countries and territories share the north american numbering plan nanp with a single country code 1 the formatting convention for telephone numbers is new people's army nxxxxxx where new people's army is the threedigit area code and nxxxxxx is the sevendigit subscriber number15 new people's army has the same syntax of nxx since the implementation of interchangeable area codes in 1995 the prefix nxx of the subscriber number is the central office code unique in the numbering plan area the place holder n stands for the digits 2 to 9 as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1 it is a closed telephone numbering plan in which all subscriber telephone numbers have seven digits in addition to the threedigit area code under allnumber calling a numbering plan introduced around 1960 local calls within an area code were placed by dialing nxxxxxx omitting the area code known as sevendigit dialing only calling a destination in a different area code required dialing the destination area code known as tendigit dialing due to the need for a larger telephone number pool in many regions sevendigit dialing is becoming rare in the united states with the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century many metropolitan areas saw the introduction of additional area codes multiple area codes were assigned to the same numbering plan area a configuration known as an overlay numbering plan calls within an overlay are still local calls despite the need for tendigit dialing in general placing longdistance calls requires dialing the trunk code 1 but this may be optional in some areas canada is a member of the north american numbering plan but administers its numbering resources individually under guidance from the nanp administrator the canadian government has stated on its language portal of canada that telephone numbers are to be written with a hyphen between each sequence as follows 1npanxxxxxx or npanxxxxxx16 10digit dialing is now required throughout most of canada including all of british columbia alberta saskatchewan manitoba quebec nova scotia and prince edward island as well as most of ontario areas not yet requiring 10digit dialing are ontarios 807 area code newfoundland and labrador new brunswick the yukon northwest territories and nunavut although 10digit dialing may be accepted in some of these areas in the province of qubec where french is the first language the office qubcois de la langue franaise has established that telephone numbers must be written with spaces first and then a hyphen for the last sequence as follows 1 new people's army nxxxxxx17 mexican telephone numbers have ten digits they can consist of a twodigit nn area code and an eightdigit local number abcd xxxx or a threedigit area code nnn with a sevendigit local number rudiment xxxx as of august 3 2019 all the indicators and access codes 01 044 045 are deprecated therefore all telephone numbers for landline or mobile service are dialed with ten digits18 the formatting convention of a telephone number is abcd xxxx or nn abcd xxxx or nn abcdxxxx rudiment twenty twenty or nnn rudiment xxxx or nnn abcxxxx the international country code prefix for mexico is 52 when dialing a number it must be formatted as plus sign country code 10digit number eg 52 nnn rudiment xxxx some central american countries write the country code for their own and other central american countries in parentheses instead of using a sign as recommended by e123 for example for a number in costa rica they would write 506 22222222 instead of 506 22222222 on the other hand guatemala does have the custom of using the sign it is quite common for central american businesses to write the whole phone number including the country code in parentheses on business cards signs stationery etc costa rican telephone numbers have eight digits and are usually written in the format 2nnnnnnn for landlines 8nnnnnnn for mobile telephone numbers from local telephone company ice 6nnnnnnn for mobile telephone numbers from movistar and 7nnnnnnn for mobile phone numbers from claro19 tollfree numbers use the format 800nnnnnnn and premiumrate telephone numbers are written 90xnnnnnnn where x varies according to the type of service offered there are also short numbers for emergencies such as 911 when costa rica switched from 7 to 8digit numbers it used a scheme similar to the 8digit number scheme already in place in el salvador at that time el salvadoran telephone numbers have eight digits usually written in the format 2nnnnnnn for landline use and 7nnnnnnn for mobile telephone numbers premiumrate numbers start with a 9 guatemalan telephone numbers have eight digits and written in the format 2nnnnnnn for landlines in guatemala city 6nnnnnnn for landlines for the rest of municipalities in the guatemala department and 7nnnnnnn for landlines in rural guatemala rest of country nongeographic numbers mobile are 5nnnnnnn 4nnnnnnn and 3nnnnnnn within each area there are different service providers the following 3 digits indicate the service provider however their assignment is on a firstcome firstserved basis additionally there are special numbers with the following conventions 3 digit numbers for emergency systems four digit numbers 15nn for information and governmental institutions and 17nn for commercial and banking institutions with a high call influx 6 digit numbers for telephone carriers numbers and making operator assisted calls collect calls these calls are billed at different rates 1800 tollfree calls redirected to out of country offices and 1801 local tollfree calls20 honduran telephone numbers have either seven digits for landlines which are usually written nnnnnnn or eight digits for mobile numbers which are written nnnnnnnn the fact that landline and mobile numbers are different lengths sometimes causes confusion in 2010 an additional digit 2 was added to the start of land line numbers thus standardizing the length at eight digits argentine telephone numbers always consist of 11 digits including the geographical area code the area code can have 3 4 or 5 digits the first being always 0 indicative of longdistance calls moreover in 1999 the whole country except buenos aires and greater buenos aires was divided into two zones roughly and with exceptions one includes most of the northern half of the country and the other most of the southern half though the actual reason for this division is not geographical but the fact that each zone is administered by a different company so the second digit of area codes can be 1 only in buenos aires and greater buenos aires code 011 or else a 2 for towns in the southern half of the country or a 3 for the northern half for example 011 for buenos aires 0341 for rosario 02627 for san rafael and the subscribers number will accordingly have 6 7 or 8 digits to complete the eleven digits phone numbers are mostly written as 011 xxxxxxxx note that only the 011 code has 3 digits 0xxx xxxxxxx or 0xxxx xxxxxx the area code is usually written between brackets in 1999 a general reform was introduced to telephone numbers including the 1 2 and 3 for area codes as explained above and adding a 4 at the beginning of all subscribers numbers however since the reform some local numbers starting with a 5 are beginning to appear moreover a hyphen is usually placed to separate the last four digits code areas do not usually include one single city or town but several neighbouring towns so the part before the hyphen called a prefix is usually indicative of either a town within the code area or even of a part of a larger city which is assigned several prefixes as a matter of fact each area code has only a limited number of prefixes assigned and these are locally limited within the area for example the 0342 area has numbers with a 456 prefix mostly located in the centre of santa fe it also has numbers with a 460 prefix usually for phone lines in the north east of the city and there are lines with a 474 prefix located in santo tom but no 444 prefix exists within this area as for the part after the hyphen it may usually be any succession of four digits though sometimes a prefix is shared by two or more small towns and then the first digit after the hyphen carries the distinction between towns sometimes a prefix is reserved for official numbers that is for offices depending on the national provincial or local state in the 0342 area this is 457 and phones within this prefix communicate with each other by simply dialing the four final digits though from other phones the prefix must be dialled as well mobile phones use the same area codes as landline telephones but the number begins with a 15 added to a string of 6 7 or 8 digits just as described above after the 15 the remainder of the number can start with a 3 a 4 a 5 or a 6 this 15 may be dropped when a call is made to a mobile phone in a different code area and when sending text messages the receivers number is best dialled both without the 15 and with the longdistance code even if both sender and receiver share a code area but without the initial 0 to sum up given the mobile phone 011 (154) 123-4567 you will call it by dialing (154) 123-4567 within the same code area 011 (154) 123-4567 from a different code area including or omitting the 15 and you will send messages to 11 41234567 even when your phone has also a 011 number two sorts of special numbers exist in argentina on the one hand threedigit numbers are used for special services such as to call the police fire brigade or emergency doctors as well as to hear the official time also telephone companies have threedigit numbers to report a problem in the lines or to ask for another subscribers number when a paper directory is not available additionally there are other longer numbers these include but are not limited to 0800 xxx abcd 0810 xxx abcd 0600 xxx abcd where the xxx indicates the same digit dialled three times and a b c and d may each be any of the ten digits 0800 lines are used by companies and it is the receiver and not the caller who pays for the call so that potential clients are encouraged to contact business companies for free 0810 lines are paid by the caller but the cost is for a local call even if you are calling from a different area the remaining is covered by the receiver and 0600 numbers are special more expensive lines that serve such purposes as television games fund collecting for charity companies hot lines etc basically a part of the extra money charged to the caller is sent to the owner of the line often the abcd or even xxxabcd part of the number is chosen if available to form a word that is representative of the company holding the number brazil is divided into 67 twodigit geographical area codes all of which with eightdigit numbers in the format aa nnnnnnnn except for cell phones which contain nine digits usually in the format aa 9nnnnnnnn peru uses 2digit area codes followed by 6digit subscriber numbers outside of lima in lima the area code is 1 and the subscriber number has seven digits divided thirty xxxx the trunk 0 is often used especially for numbers outside lima for example a phone number in arequipa might be written 054 xxxxxx cellphone numbers used to have eight digits with the first digit always being 9 in 2008 an additional digit was added to cellphone numbers while land numbers remained the same the previous convention for cell numbers in lima was usually 9xxx xxxx though 9xxx xxxx was also used with the new 9digit number the form 9xx thirty thirty is becoming increasingly common as opposed to 9 xxxx xxxx 9x thirty xxxx or 9xxxx xxxx outside lima cellphone numbers used to be 9 followed by six digits ie 9 thirty thirty the 2008 changes were somewhat more complicated in four departments similar to states a 2 digit code now has to be entered before the 9 in the example of arequipa the code of 95 has to be entered before the 9 so the new numeration is 959 thirty thirty the other codes are 94 for la libertad trujillo 96 for piura and 97 for lambayeque chiclayo in the other 19 rural departments the 9 is followed by the departments 2digit area code then the 6digit subscriber number for example the area code for cusco is 84 so their new cellphone numeration is 984 thirty thirty the effect is that all peruvian cellphone numbers now have nine digits under the old system they had eight digits in lima and 7 everywhere else21 long distance calling short code karachi and lahore now have eight digit phone numbers
