      "['\\n\\nvolume i\\n\\nchapter i\\n\\n\\nemma woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\\nand happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings\\nof existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world\\nwith very little to distress or vex her.', \"she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period.\", 'her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection.', \"sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr. woodhouse's family,\\nless as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,\\nbut particularly of emma.\", 'between _them_ it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters.', \"even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away, they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached, and emma doing just what she liked;\\nhighly esteeming miss taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by\\nher own.\", \"the real evils, indeed, of emma's situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments.\", 'the danger, however, was at present\\nso unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her.', 'sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--miss taylor married.', \"it was miss\\ntaylor's loss which first brought grief.\", 'it was on the wedding-day\\nof this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance.', 'the wedding over, and the bride-people gone,\\nher father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening.', 'her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost.', 'the event had every promise of happiness for her friend.', \"mr. weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,\\nand pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.\", 'the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day.', 'she recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen\\nyears--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood.', \"a large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed isabella's marriage, on their\\nbeing left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.\", 'she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,\\nwell-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,\\ninterested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\\nin every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault.', 'how was she to bear the change?--it was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them; but emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a mrs. weston, only half a mile from them,\\nand a miss taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,\\nnatural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude.', 'she dearly loved her father, but he\\nwas no companion for her.', 'he could not meet her in conversation,\\nrational or playful.', 'the evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and mr. woodhouse had\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity\\nof mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time.', 'her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,\\nbeing settled in london, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond\\nher daily reach; and many a long october and november evening must\\nbe struggled through at hartfield, before christmas brought the next\\nvisit from isabella and her husband, and their little children,\\nto fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.', 'highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\nto which hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,\\nand name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.', 'the woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there.', 'she had\\nmany acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss\\ntaylor for even half a day.', 'it was a melancholy change; and emma\\ncould not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,\\ntill her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.', 'he was a nervous man, easily depressed;\\nfond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;\\nhating change of every kind.', \"matrimony, as the origin of change,\\nwas always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too; and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself,\\nhe was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield.\", 'emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\n\\n\"poor miss taylor!--i wish she were here again.', 'what a pity it\\nis that mr. weston ever thought of her!\"', '\"i cannot agree with you, papa; you know i cannot.', 'mr. weston is such\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wife;--and you would not have had miss taylor live with us\\nfor ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?\"', '\"a house of her own!--but where is the advantage of a house of her own?', 'this is three times as large.--and you have never any odd humours,\\nmy dear.\"', '\"how often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see\\nus!--we shall be always meeting!', '_we_ must begin; we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon.\"', '\"my dear, how am i to get so far?', 'i could not walk half so far.\"', '\"no, papa, nobody thought of your walking.', 'we must go in the carriage,\\nto be sure.\"', 'but james will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit?\"', '\"they are to be put into mr. weston\\'s stable, papa.', 'you know we\\nhave settled all that already.', 'we talked it all over with mr. weston\\nlast night.', \"and as for james, you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.\", 'i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.', 'you got hannah that good place.', 'nobody thought\\nof hannah till you mentioned her--james is so obliged to you!\"', '\"i am very glad i did think of her.', 'it was very lucky, for i would\\nnot have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account;\\nand i am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,\\npretty-spoken girl; i have a great opinion of her.', 'whenever i see her,\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how i do, in a very pretty manner;\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework, i observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.', 'i am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see.', 'whenever james goes over to see his daughter, you know,\\nshe will be hearing of us.', 'he will be able to tell her how we\\nall are.\"', 'emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,\\nand hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.', 'the backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary.', \"mr. knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of isabella's husband.\", 'he lived about a mile from highbury, was a frequent visitor,\\nand always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in london.', \"he had\\nreturned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked\\nup to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square.\", 'it was a happy circumstance, and animated mr. woodhouse for some time.', 'mr. knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;\\nand his many inquiries after \"poor isabella\" and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily.', 'when this was over, mr. woodhouse\\ngratefully observed, \"it is very kind of you, mr. knightley, to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us.', 'i am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk.\"', 'it is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild\\nthat i must draw back from your great fire.\"', '\"but you must have found it very damp and dirty.', 'i wish you may\\nnot catch cold.\"', 'that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here.', 'it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast.', 'i wanted them to put off the wedding.\"', '\"by the bye--i have not wished you joy.', 'being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy

well-meaning, respectable young man,\\nwithout any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.', \"she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which

usual weight and efficacy.\", 'and he was really a very pleasing\\nyoung man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.', \"he was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in

harriet,\\nbut will not dine alone for her.\"', \"soon afterwards mr. elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment\\nin his manner of naming harriet at parting; in the tone of his\\nvoice while assuring her that he should call at mrs. goddard's\\nfor news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared\\nfor the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be\\nable to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself\\noff in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.\", 'after a few minutes of entire silence between them, john knightley\\nbegan with--\\n\\n\"i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\\nmr. elton.', 'it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.', 'with men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies\\nto please, every feature works.\"', '\"mr. elton\\'s manners are not perfect,\" replied emma; \"but where there\\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook\\na great deal.', 'where a man does his best with only moderate powers,\\nhe will have the advantage over negligent superiority.', 'there is\\nsuch perfect good-temper and good-will in mr. elton as one cannot\\nbut value.\"', '\"yes,\" said mr. john knightley presently, with some slyness,\\n\"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"', 'she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining\\nme to be mr. elton\\'s object?\"', '\"such an imagination has crossed me, i own, emma; and if it never\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"', '\"mr. elton in love with me!--what an idea!\"', '\"i do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether\\nit is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.', 'i think your manners to him encouraging.', 'i speak as a friend,\\nemma.', 'you had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,\\nand what you mean to do.\"', '\"i thank you; but i assure you you are quite mistaken.', 'mr. elton\\nand i are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on,\\namusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often\\narise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes\\nwhich people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;\\nand not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind\\nand ignorant, and in want of counsel.', 'mr. woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,\\nthat in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea\\nof shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually\\nwith his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent\\nconsciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full\\nof the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at\\nrandalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.', 'the cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage\\nwas in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,\\nand the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only\\na milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.', 'emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.', 'the preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice\\nof his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\nwhich mr. john knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;\\nand the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in\\nexpressing his discontent.', '\"a man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when\\nhe asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such\\na day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.', 'he must think\\nhimself a most agreeable fellow; i could not do such a thing.', \"it is the greatest absurdity--actually snowing at this moment!--\\nthe folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the\\nfolly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can!\", \"if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of\\nduty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,\\nprobably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward\\nvoluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,\\nwhich tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,\\nto stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--\\nhere are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another\\nman's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\", 'going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses\\nand four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,\\nshivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they\\nmight have had at home.\"', 'emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt\\nhe was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \"very true, my love,\"\\nwhich must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;\\nbut she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer\\nat all.', 'she could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;\\nher heroism reached only to silence.', 'she allowed him to talk,\\nand arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\nher lips.', 'they arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,\\nand mr. elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.', 'emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.', 'mr. elton\\nwas all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful\\nin his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have\\nreceived a different account of harriet from what had reached her.', 'she had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, \"much the same--\\nnot better.\"', '\"_my_ report from mrs. goddard\\'s,\" said she presently, \"was not\\nso pleasant as i had hoped--`not better\\' was _my_ answer.\"', 'his face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice\\nof sentiment as he answered.', \"no--i am grieved to find--i was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen i called at mrs. goddard's door, which i did the very last thing\\nbefore i returned to dress, i was told that miss smith was not better,\\nby no means better, rather worse.\", 'very much grieved and concerned--\\ni had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial\\nas i knew had been given her in the morning.\"', 'emma smiled and answered--\"my visit was of use to the nervous part\\nof her complaint, i hope; but not even i can charm away a sore throat;\\nit is a most severe cold indeed.', 'mr. perry has been with her,\\nas you probably heard.\"', '\"yes--i imagined--that is--i did not--\"\\n\\n\"he has been used to her in these complaints, and i hope to-morrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report.', 'but it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness.', 'such a sad loss to our party to-day!\"', '\"dreadful!--exactly so, indeed.--she will be missed every moment.\"', 'this was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;\\nbut it should have lasted longer.', 'emma was rather in dismay when\\nonly half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.', '\"what an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin\\nfor carriages.', 'how very comfortable they make it;--impossible to\\nfeel cold with such precautions.', \"the contrivances of modern days\\nindeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete.\", 'one is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath\\nof air can find its way unpermitted.', 'weather becomes absolutely\\nof no consequence.', 'it is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage\\nwe know nothing of the matter.--ha!', '\"yes,\" said john knightley, \"and i think we shall have a good deal\\nof it.\"', '\"quite seasonable;\\nand extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not\\nbegin yesterday, and prevent this day\\'s party, which it might very\\npossibly have done, for mr. woodhouse would hardly have ventured had\\nthere been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.', 'this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.', 'at christmas\\nevery body invites their friends about them, and people think little\\nof even the worst weather.', \"i was snowed up at a friend's house once\\nfor a week.\", 'i went for only one night,\\nand could not get away till that very day se\\'nnight.\"', 'mr. john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,\\nbut said only, coolly,\\n\\n\"i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls.\"', \"at another time emma might have been amused, but she was too\\nmuch astonished now at mr. elton's spirits for other feelings.\", 'harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.', '\"we are sure of excellent fires,\" continued he, \"and every thing\\nin the greatest comfort.', 'charming people, mr. and mrs. weston;--\\nmrs. weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly\\nwhat one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--\\nit will be a small party, but where small parties are select,\\nthey are perhaps the most agreeable of any.', \"mr. weston's dining-room\\ndoes not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,\\ni would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than\\nexceed by two.\", 'i think you will agree with me, (turning with a

know nothing of the large parties of london, sir--i never dine\\nwith any body.\"', '(in a tone of wonder and pity,) i had no idea that the\\nlaw had been so great a slavery.', 'well, sir, the time must come\\nwhen you will be paid for all this, when you will have little\\nlabour and great enjoyment.\"', '\"my first enjoyment,\" replied john knightley, as they passed through\\nthe sweep-gate, \"will be to find myself safe at hartfield again.\"', \"chapter xiv\\n\\n\\nsome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman\\nas they walked into mrs. weston's drawing-room;--mr. elton must\\ncompose his joyous looks, and mr. john knightley disperse his\\nill-humour.\", 'mr. elton must smile less, and mr. john knightley more,\\nto fit them for the place.--emma only might be as nature prompted,\\nand shew herself just as happy as she was.', 'to her it was real\\nenjoyment to be with the westons.', 'mr. weston was a great favourite,\\nand there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with\\nsuch unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related\\nwith such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being\\nalways interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,\\narrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.', \"she could tell nothing of hartfield, in which mrs. weston had not\\na lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private\\nlife depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\", \"this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might\\nnot afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;\\nbut the very sight of mrs. weston, her smile, her touch, her voice\\nwas grateful to emma, and she determined to think as little as\\npossible of mr. elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,\\nand enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.\", \"the misfortune of harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival.\", \"mr. woodhouse had been safely seated long\\nenough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own\\nand isabella's coming, and of emma's being to follow, and had indeed\\njust got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come\\nand see his daughter, when the others appeared, and mrs. weston,\\nwho had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,\\nwas able to turn away and welcome her dear emma.\", \"emma's project of forgetting mr. elton for a while made her rather\\nsorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was\\nclose to her.\", 'the difficulty was great of driving his strange\\ninsensibility towards harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat\\nat her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance\\non her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.', 'instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could\\nnot avoid the internal suggestion of \"can it really be as my brother\\nimagined?', 'can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer\\nhis affections from harriet to me?--absurd and insufferable!\"', '--\\nyet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be\\nso interested about her father, and so delighted with mrs. weston;\\nand at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal\\nand so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,\\nand made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.', \"for her own sake she could not be rude; and for harriet's, in the hope\\nthat all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;\\nbut it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst\\nthe others, in the most overpowering period of mr. elton's nonsense,\\nwhich she particularly wished to listen to.\", 'she heard enough\\nto know that mr. weston was giving some information about his son;\\nshe heard the words \"my son,\" and \"frank,\" and \"my son,\"\\nrepeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables\\nvery much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from\\nhis son; but before she could quiet mr. elton, the subject was\\nso completely past that any reviving question from her would have\\nbeen awkward.', \"now, it so happened that in spite of emma's resolution of never marrying,\\nthere was something in the name, in the idea of mr. frank churchill,\\nwhich always interested her.\", \"she had frequently thought--especially since\\nhis father's marriage with miss taylor--that if she _were_ to marry,\\nhe was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.\", 'he seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her.', 'she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew\\nthem must think of.', \"that mr. and mrs. weston did think of it, she was\\nvery strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,\\nor by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more\\nreplete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great\\ncuriosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,\\nof being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure\\nin the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.\", \"with such sensations, mr. elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling\\nvery cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not\\npossibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,\\nor the substance of it, from the open-hearted mr.\", 'weston.--so it proved;--\\nfor when happily released from mr. elton, and seated by mr. weston,\\nat dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares\\nof hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,\\nto say to her,\\n\\n\"we want only two more to be just the right number.', 'i should\\nlike to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, miss smith,\\nand my son--and then i should say we were quite complete.', 'i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room\\nthat we are expecting frank.', 'i had a letter from him this morning,\\nand he will be with us within a fortnight.\"', 'emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented\\nto his proposition of mr. frank churchill and miss smith making\\ntheir party quite complete.', '\"he has been wanting to come to us,\" continued mr. weston,\\n\"ever since september:  every letter has been full of it;\\nbut he cannot command his own time.', 'he has those to please\\nwho must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes\\nto be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.', 'but now\\ni have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january.\"', '\"what a very great pleasure it will be to you!', 'and mrs. weston\\nis so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost\\nas happy as yourself.\"', '\"yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another\\nput-off.', 'she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do:\\nbut she does not know the parties so well as i do.', 'the case,\\nyou see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:  i did not mention\\na syllable of it in the other room.', \"there are secrets in all families,\\nyou know)--the case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay\\na visit at enscombe in january; and that frank's coming depends upon\\ntheir being put off.\", 'if they are not put off, he cannot stir.', 'but i know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,\\nof some consequence, at enscombe, has a particular dislike to:\\nand though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or\\nthree years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.', 'i have not the smallest doubt of the issue.', 'i am as confident\\nof seeing frank here before the middle of january, as i am\\nof being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding\\ntowards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,\\nand has been so little used to them at hartfield, that she cannot\\ncalculate on their effects, as i have been long in the practice\\nof doing.\"', '\"i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\"\\nreplied emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, mr. weston.', 'if you\\nthink he will come, i shall think so too; for you know enscombe.\"', '\"yes--i have some right to that knowledge; though i have never been\\nat the place in my life.--she is an odd woman!--but i never allow\\nmyself to speak ill of her, on frank\\'s account; for i do believe\\nher to be very fond of him.', 'i used to think she was not capable\\nof being fond of any body, except herself:  but she has always been\\nkind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,\\nand expecting every thing to be as she likes).', 'and it is no small credit,\\nin my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;\\nfor, though i would not say it to any body else, she has no more\\nheart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.\"', 'emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to mrs. weston,\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--\\nyet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\\nmrs. weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very\\nglad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting\\nat the time talked of:  \"for i cannot depend upon his coming.', 'i cannot be so sanguine as mr. weston.', 'i am very much afraid\\nthat it will all end in nothing.', 'mr. weston, i dare say, has been\\ntelling you exactly how the matter stands?\"', '\"yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour\\nof mrs. churchill, which i imagine to be the most certain\\nthing in the world.\"', 'replied mrs. weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty\\nof caprice?\"', 'then turning to isabella, who had not been\\nattending before--\"you must know, my dear mrs. knightley,\\nthat we are by no means so sure of seeing mr. frank churchill,\\nin my opinion, as his father thinks.', \"it depends entirely upon\\nhis aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.\", 'to you--to my two daughters--i may venture on the truth.', 'mrs. churchill rules at enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;\\nand his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\"', '\"oh, mrs. churchill; every body knows mrs. churchill,\"\\nreplied isabella:  \"and i am sure i never think of that poor young\\nman without the greatest compassion.', 'to be constantly living\\nwith an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.', 'it is what we\\nhappily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life\\nof misery.', 'what a blessing, that she never had any children!', 'poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\"', 'emma wished she had been alone with mrs. weston.', 'she should then have\\nheard more:  mrs. weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with isabella; and, she really believed,\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills\\nfrom her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.', 'but at present there was nothing more to be said.', 'mr. woodhouse\\nvery soon followed them into the drawing-room.', 'to be sitting\\nlong after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.', 'neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did\\nhe move to those with whom he was always comfortable.', 'while he talked to isabella, however, emma found an opportunity\\nof saying,\\n\\n\"and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any\\nmeans certain.', 'the introduction must be unpleasant,\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"', '\"yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.', 'even if this family, the braithwaites, are put off, i am still\\nafraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.', \"i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but i am sure\\nthere is a great wish on the churchills' to keep him to themselves.\", 'they are jealous even of his regard for his father.', 'in short, i can feel no dependence on his coming, and i wish mr. weston\\nwere less sanguine.\"', '\"he ought to come,\" said emma.', '\"if he could stay only a couple\\nof days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man\\'s\\nnot having it in his power to do as much as that.', 'a young _woman_,\\nif she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance\\nfrom those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young\\n_man_\\'s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week\\nwith his father, if he likes it.\"', '\"one ought to be at enscombe, and know the ways of the family,\\nbefore one decides upon what he can do,\" replied mrs. weston.', '\"one ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the\\nconduct of any one individual of any one family; but enscombe,\\ni believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:\\n_she_ is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.\"', '\"but she is so fond of the nephew:  he is so very great a favourite.', 'now, according to my idea of mrs. churchill, it would be most natural,\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,\\nto whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,\\nto whom she owes nothing at all.\"', '\"my dearest emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,\\nto understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:  you must\\nlet it go its own way.', 'i have no doubt of his having, at times,\\nconsiderable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him\\nto know beforehand _when_ it will be.\"', 'emma listened, and then coolly said, \"i shall not be satisfied,\\nunless he comes.\"', '\"he may have a great deal of influence on some points,\"\\ncontinued mrs. weston, \"and on others, very little:  and among those,\\non which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be\\nthis very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.\"', 'chapter xv\\n\\n\\nmr. woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\\ntea

resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,\\nand retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,\\nequal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.', 'the good sense of colonel and mrs. campbell could not oppose such\\na resolution, though their feelings did.', 'as long as they lived,\\nno exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;\\nand for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;\\nbut this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better\\nbe soon.', 'perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder\\nand wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared\\nher from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must\\nnow be relinquished.', 'still, however, affection was glad to catch\\nat any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.', \"she had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage;\\nand till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,\\nthey must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being\\ncompatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,\\nunder the most favourable circumstances, to require something\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\ntolerable comfort.\", 'with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland, her account\\nto her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some\\ntruths not told.', 'it was her own choice to give the time of their\\nabsence to highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect\\nliberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:\\nand the campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,\\nwhether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement\\ntheir ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few\\nmonths spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,\\nthan on any thing else.', \"certain it was that she was to come;\\nand that highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\nhad been so long promised it--mr. frank churchill--must put up for\\nthe present with jane fairfax, who could bring only the freshness\\nof a two years' absence.\", 'emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did\\nnot like through three long months!--to be always doing more than\\nshe wished, and less than she ought!', 'why she did not like jane\\nfairfax might be a difficult question to answer; mr. knightley\\nhad once told her it was because she saw in her the really\\naccomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;\\nand though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,\\nthere were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could\\nnot quite acquit her.', 'but \"she could never get acquainted with her:\\nshe did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--\\nsuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,\\nher aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss\\nwith by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were\\nto be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had\\nsupposed they must be so fond of each other.\"', 'these were her reasons--\\nshe had no better.', \"it was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy, that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;\\nand now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\\ninterval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance\\nand manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\", 'jane fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had\\nherself the highest value for elegance.', 'her height was pretty,\\njust such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could\\nthink very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most\\nbecoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance\\nof ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.', 'emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--\\nthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;\\nit was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.', 'her eyes,\\na deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied\\ntheir praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,\\nas wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\\nno fuller bloom.', 'it was a style of beauty, of which elegance\\nwas the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,\\nby all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person\\nor of mind, she saw so little in highbury.', 'there, not to be vulgar,\\nwas distinction, and merit.', 'in short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at jane fairfax\\nwith twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense\\nof rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike\\nher no longer.', 'when she took in her history, indeed, her situation,\\nas well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance\\nwas destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going\\nto live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion\\nand respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling\\nher to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance\\nof an attachment to mr. dixon, which she had so naturally started\\nto herself.', 'in that case, nothing could be more pitiable\\nor more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.', \"emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\\nmr. dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous\\nwhich her imagination had suggested at first.\", 'if it were love,\\nit might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.', 'she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,\\nwhile a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,\\nthe purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit\\nto ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from\\nhim and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.', 'upon the whole, emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\\nas made her look around in walking home, and lament that highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;\\nnobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.', 'these were charming feelings--but not lasting.', 'before she had\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\njane fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices\\nand errors, than saying to mr. knightley, \"she certainly is handsome;\\nshe is better than handsome!\"', 'jane had spent an evening at hartfield\\nwith her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much\\ninto its usual state.', \"the aunt\\nwas as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her\\nhealth was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to\\nlisten to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\\nshe ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,\\nas well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her\\nmother and herself; and jane's offences rose again.\", 'they had music;\\nemma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily\\nfollowed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air\\nof greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\nsuperior performance.', 'she was, besides, which was the worst of all,\\nso cold, so cautious!', 'there was no getting at her real opinion.', 'wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined\\nto hazard nothing.', 'she was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.', 'if any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more\\nreserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing.', \"she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr. dixon's character,\\nor her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness\\nof the match.\", 'it was all general approbation and smoothness;\\nnothing delineated or distinguished.', 'it did her no service however.', 'emma saw its artifice, and returned\\nto her first surmises.', 'there probably _was_ something more to conceal\\nthan her own preference; mr. dixon, perhaps, had been very near\\nchanging one friend for the other, or been fixed only to miss campbell,\\nfor the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.', 'the like reserve prevailed on other topics.', 'she and mr. frank churchill\\nhad been at weymouth at the same time.', 'it was known that they were\\na little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was.', '--\"she believed\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man.\"', '--\\n\"he was generally thought so.\"', '\"did he appear a sensible young man;\\na young man of information?\"', '--\"at a watering-place, or in a common\\nlondon acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.',

iii\\n\\n\\nemma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by mr. knightley, who had been of the party, and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,\\nhe was expressing the next morning, being at hartfield again on\\nbusiness with mr. woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so\\nopenly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,\\nbut speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma.', 'he had been used to think her unjust to jane, and had now great\\npleasure in marking an improvement.',

woodhouse,\\nin his quiet way.', 'once, i felt the fire rather too much;\\nbut then i moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did\\nnot disturb me.', 'miss bates was very chatty and

earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half\\na day.', '\"i told you yesterday,\" cried mr. weston with exultation, \"i told\\nyou all that he would be here before the time named.', 'i remembered\\nwhat i used to do myself.', 'one cannot creep upon a journey;\\none cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the\\npleasure of coming in upon one\\'s friends before the

to make himself agreeable;\\nthe conviction was strengthened by what followed.', \"he was very much\\npleased with randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,\\nwould hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,\\nthe walk to highbury, highbury itself, hartfield still more,\\nand professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest\\nin the country which none but one's _own_ country gives, and the\\ngreatest curiosity to visit it.\", \"that he should never have been\\nable to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously\\nthrough emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a\\npleasant one, and pleasantly handled.\", 'his manner had no air of study\\nor exaggeration.', 'he did really look and speak as if in a state of no\\ncommon enjoyment.', 'their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.', 'on his side were the inquiries,--\"was she a horsewoman?--pleasant rides?--\\npleasant walks?--had they a large neighbourhood?--highbury, perhaps,\\nafforded society enough?--there were several very pretty houses\\nin and about it.--balls--had they balls?--was it a musical society?\"', 'but when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,\\nwhile their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing\\nhis mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,\\nso much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she\\nsecured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,\\nas was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--\\nand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.', 'he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be\\nthoroughly deserved by mrs. weston; but, undoubtedly he could know\\nvery little of the matter.', 'he understood what would be welcome;\\nhe could be sure of little else.', '\"his father\\'s marriage,\" he said,\\n\"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;\\nand the family from whom he had received such a blessing must\\nbe ever considered as having conferred the highest

that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouse's\\ncharacter, than miss woodhouse miss taylor's.\", 'and at last, as if resolved\\nto qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he\\nwound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.', '\"elegant, agreeable manners, i was prepared for,\" said he;\\n\"but i confess that, considering every thing, i had not expected\\nmore than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;\\ni did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs.', '\"you cannot see too much perfection in mrs. weston for

dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,\\nand congratulations on her side, and explanations on miss bates's, was,\\nthat this pianoforte had arrived from broadwood's the day before,\\nto the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;\\nthat at first, by miss bates's account, jane herself was quite at\\na loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered

another, and our little girls, who are\\nbut just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;\\nand there is poor jane fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest\\nold spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--i was saying this\\nto mr. cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he\\nis so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging\\nhimself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might\\nbe so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;\\nand that really

inspection.\", 'emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which\\nmr. weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and\\nintimate of a man who had so many intimates and

benevolence,\\nbut not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--\\nshe could fancy such a man.', 'the whole party walked about,\\nand looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,\\nformed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their\\nvarious modes, till other subjects were started, that, though _may_,\\na fire in the evening was still very pleasant.',

how gentlemanlike\\na manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he\\nbut take the trouble.--whenever she caught his eye, she forced him\\nto smile; but in general he was looking grave.\", 'she wished he could\\nlove a ballroom better, and could like frank churchill better.--\\nhe seemed often observing her.', 'she must not flatter herself that he\\nthought of her dancing, but

glances.--the kind-hearted,\\ngentle mrs. weston had left her seat to join him and say, \"do not\\nyou dance, mr.', 'to which his prompt reply was, \"most readily,\\nmrs. weston, if you will dance

down, and not to heat themselves.--\\nmrs. weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,\\nand sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others\\nwere invited or persuaded

prospect,\\nhad scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,\\nwhich neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--the house\\nwas larger than hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good\\ndeal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,\\nand one or two handsome rooms.--it was just what it ought to be,\\nand it looked what it was--and emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,\\nuntainted in blood and understanding.--some faults of temper john\\nknightley had; but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.', 'she had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could\\nraise a blush.', 'these were pleasant feelings, and she walked about\\nand indulged them till it was

by mrs. weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her\\nson-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--\\nshe had some fears of his horse.', 'seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now emma was obliged\\nto overhear what mrs. elton and jane fairfax were talking of.--\\na situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.', 'mrs. elton\\nhad received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.', 'it was not with mrs. suckling, it was not with mrs. bragge,\\nbut in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:  it was\\nwith a cousin of mrs.

removal.--\\n\"should not they walk?', 'would not mr. knightley shew them the gardens--\\nall the gardens?--she wished to see the whole extent.\"', '--the pertinacity\\nof her friend seemed more than she could bear.', 'it was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\\ndispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short\\navenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal\\ndistance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--\\nit led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone\\nwall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,\\nto give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had\\nbeen there.', 'disputable, however, as might be the taste of such\\na termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view\\nwhich closed it extremely pretty.--the considerable slope, at nearly\\nthe foot of which the abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\\nform beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank\\nof considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--\\nand at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,\\nrose the abbey mill farm, with meadows in front, and the river\\nmaking a close and handsome curve around it.', 'it was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.', 'english verdure,\\nenglish culture, english comfort, seen under a sun bright,\\nwithout being oppressive.', 'in this walk emma and mr. weston found all the others assembled;\\nand towards this view she immediately perceived mr. knightley\\nand harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.', 'mr. knightley and harriet!--it was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was\\nglad to see it.--there had been a time when he would have scorned\\nher as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.', 'now they seemed in pleasant conversation.', 'there had been a time\\nalso when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot\\nso favourable for the abbey mill farm; but now she feared it not.', 'it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity\\nand beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,\\nand light column of smoke ascending.--she joined them at the wall,\\nand found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.', 'he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.', 'and emma received a smile which seemed to say, \"these are my\\nown concerns.', 'i have a right to talk on such subjects, without being\\nsuspected of introducing robert martin.\"', 'it was too old a story.--robert martin had probably ceased to think\\nof harriet.--they took a few turns together along the walk.--the shade\\nwas most refreshing, and emma found it the pleasantest part of\\nthe day.', 'the next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--\\nand they were all seated and busy, and still frank churchill did\\nnot come.', 'mrs. weston looked, and looked in vain.', 'his father would\\nnot own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could\\nnot be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.', 'he had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.', '\"his aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting\\nover to them.\"--mrs.', \"churchill's

of justice\\nby harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl\\nwho believed herself loved by mr. knightley--but justice required\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness

contained, when separated from all the feebleness and\\ntautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--\\nespecially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory\\nbrought in favour of mr. knightley's most improved opinion of harriet.\", 'harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dances.--emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\\nfound her much superior to his expectation.', \"from that evening,\\nor at least from the time of miss woodhouse's encouraging her\\nto think of him, harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking\\nto her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having\\nindeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness\\nand sweetness!--latterly she had been more and more aware of it.\", 'when they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked\\nby her, and talked so very delightfully!--he seemed to want to be\\nacquainted with her.', 'emma knew it to have been very much the case.', 'she had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--\\nharriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--\\nand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\\nknown of his opinion of harriet.', \"he praised her for being without\\nart or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--\\nshe knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet; he had dwelt\\non them to her more than once.--much that lived in harriet's memory,\\nmany little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,\\na speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,\\na preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\\nby emma.\", \"circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences\\nto be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to harriet, were not\\nwithout some degree of witness from emma herself.--the first,\\nwas his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk\\nat donwell, where they had been walking some time before emma came,\\nand he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from\\nthe rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more\\nparticular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular\\nway indeed!--(harriet could not recall it without a blush.)\", 'he seemed\\nto be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--\\nbut as soon as she (miss woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,\\nhe changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--\\nthe second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\\nbefore emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his\\nbeing at hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said\\nthat he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,\\nduring their conversation, that though he must go to london,\\nit was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,\\nwhich was much more (as emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.', 'the superior degree of confidence towards harriet, which this one\\narticle marked, gave her severe pain.', 'on the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,\\nafter a little reflection, venture the following question.', '\"might he not?--is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,\\ninto the state of your affections, he might be alluding to mr. martin--\\nhe might have mr. martin\\'s interest in view?', 'but harriet rejected\\nthe suspicion with spirit.', 'no indeed!--there was not a hint of mr. martin.', 'i hope i know better now, than to care for mr. martin, or to be\\nsuspected of it.\"', 'when harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear\\nmiss woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.', '\"i never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she,\\n\"but for you.', 'you told me to observe him carefully, and let\\nhis behaviour be the rule of mine--and so i have.', 'but now i seem\\nto feel that i may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,\\nit will not be any thing so very wonderful.\"', 'the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\\nfeelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on emma\\'s side,\\nto enable her to say on reply,\\n\\n\"harriet, i will only venture to declare, that mr. knightley is\\nthe last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman\\nthe idea of his feeling for her more than he really does.\"', \"harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;\\nand emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at\\nthat moment would have been

spontaneous\\nburst of emma\\'s feelings:  \"oh god!', 'that i had never seen her!\"', 'the rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough\\nfor her thoughts.--she was bewildered amidst the confusion\\nof all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.', 'every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize\\nmust be matter of humiliation to her.--how to understand it all!', 'how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising\\non herself, and living under!--the blunders, the blindness of her\\nown head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her\\nown room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,\\nshe perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed\\non by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing\\non herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,\\nand should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.', 'to understand, thoroughly

excited by it; or if it were,\\nthat it would be of any consequence; for \"such things,\" he observed,\\n\"always got about.\"', 'emma smiled, and felt that mr. weston had\\nvery good reason for saying so.', 'they had gone, in short--and very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.', 'she had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action\\nhad shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.', 'the quiet,\\nheart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight\\nof her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,\\nhad been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.', 'they were\\nboth so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested\\nin every sensation; thought so much of jane; so much of every body,\\nand so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work\\nfor them.', \"miss fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea\\nfor mrs. weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and\\ndeclined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the\\ncourse of their drive, mrs. weston had, by gentle encouragement,\\novercome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse\\non the important subject.\", 'apologies for her seemingly ungracious\\nsilence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the\\ngratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr. weston,\\nmust necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,\\nthey had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state\\nof the engagement.', 'mrs. weston was convinced that such conversation\\nmust be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own\\nmind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased\\nwith all that she had said on the subject.', '\"on the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment\\nof so many months,\" continued mrs. weston, \"she was energetic.', 'this was one of her expressions.', '`i will not say, that since i\\nentered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments; but i\\ncan say, that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:\\'--\\nand the quivering lip, emma, which uttered it, was an attestation\\nthat i felt at my heart.\"', '\"she thinks herself wrong, then, for having\\nconsented to a private engagement?\"', 'no one, i believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\\nto blame herself.', \"`the consequence,' said she, `has been a state\\nof perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.\", 'but after all the\\npunishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.', \"i have been acting\\ncontrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\\nthing has taken, and the kindness i am now receiving, is what my\\nconscience tells me ought not to be.'\", \"`do not imagine, madam,'\\nshe continued, `that i was taught wrong.\", 'do not let any reflection\\nfall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought\\nme up.', 'the error has been all my own; and i do assure you that,\\nwith all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,\\ni shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell.\\'\"', '\"she loves him then excessively,\\ni suppose.', 'it must have been from attachment only, that she could\\nbe led to form the engagement.', 'her affection must have overpowered\\nher judgment.\"', '\"yes, i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\"', '\"i am afraid,\" returned emma, sighing, \"that i must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy.\"', '\"on your side, my love, it was very innocently done.', 'but she\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding\\nto the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.', 'one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\"\\nshe said, \"was that of making her _unreasonable_.', 'the consciousness\\nof having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,\\nand made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--\\nthat had been--hard for him to bear.', \"`i did not make the allowances,'\\nsaid she, `which i ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--\\nhis delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness\\nof disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, i am sure,\\nhave been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'\", 'she then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you\\nhad shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me\\nhow it was all connected, desired me, whenever i had an opportunity,\\nto thank you--i could not thank you too much--for every wish and\\nevery endeavour to do her good.', 'she was sensible that you had never\\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself.\"', '\"if i did not know her to be happy now,\" said emma, seriously,\\n\"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous\\nconscience, she must be, i could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!', 'mrs. weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil\\nand the good i have done miss fairfax!--well (checking herself,\\nand trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.', 'you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.', 'they shew her to the greatest advantage.', 'i am sure she is very good--\\ni hope she will be very happy.', 'it is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side, for i think the merit will be all on hers.\"', 'such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs. weston.', 'she thought well of frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,\\nshe loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.', 'she talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--\\nbut she had too much to urge for emma\\'s attention; it was soon gone\\nto brunswick square or to donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;\\nand when mrs. weston ended with, \"we have not yet had the letter\\nwe are so anxious for, you know, but i hope it will soon come,\"\\nshe was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged\\nto answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it\\nwas which they were so anxious for.', 'i am always well, you know.', 'be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\"', \"mrs. weston's communications furnished emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,\\nand her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax.\", 'she bitterly\\nregretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed\\nfor the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,\\nthe cause.', \"had she followed mr.

find a friend there instead of in harriet smith;\\nshe must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain\\nwhich pressed on her now.--birth, abilities, and education,\\nhad been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received\\nwith gratitude; and the other--what was she?--supposing even that\\nthey had never become intimate friends; that she had never been\\nadmitted into miss fairfax's confidence on this important matter--\\nwhich was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,\\nand as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable\\nsuspicions of an improper attachment to mr. dixon, which she had\\nnot only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\\nunpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made\\na subject of material distress to the delicacy of jane's feelings,\\nby the levity or carelessness of frank churchill's.\", 'of all the sources\\nof evil surrounding the former,

over.\", 'the picture which\\nshe had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,\\nhad proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures\\nhad been lost.--but her present

her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it\\nsuited her to give.', 'and this belief produced another dread.', 'perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to harriet;\\nhe might be

full weight of their separate claims;\\nand how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.', 'with respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.', 'she hardly knew yet

supposed,\\nwithout reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in\\nher style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--\\nit might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.', \"she had no difficulty in procuring isabella's invitation;\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,\\nwithout resorting to invention.--there was a tooth amiss.\", 'harriet really

persuadable.--\\nharriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was\\nto be conveyed in mr. woodhouse's carriage.--it was all arranged,\\nit was all completed, and harriet was safe in brunswick square.\", \"now emma could, indeed, enjoy mr. knightley's visits; now she\\ncould talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice, of guilt, of

she had led astray herself.\", \"the difference of harriet at mrs. goddard's, or in london, made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in emma's sensations; but she could not\\nthink of her in london

the assistance which isabella could give, by letters\\nof the strongest approbation; and mrs. weston was ready,\\non the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most\\nserviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--\\nwell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\\nto mr. woodhouse's mind.--it was agreed upon, as what was to be;\\nand every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\\nit would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself\\nwhich almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--\\nin

the utmost.--she had such a regard\\nfor mr. knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest emma;\\nand it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable\\na connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,\\nso peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed\\nas if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,\\nand that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\\nthought of it, and wished it long ago.--how very few of those men\\nin a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their

knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress\\nwould be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.', \"in this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\\nillumination of mr. woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\\nnervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--\\nmrs. weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--\\nevidently by the ingenuity of man.\", \"other poultry-yards in the\\nneighbourhood also suffered.--pilfering was _housebreaking_ to\\nmr. woodhouse's fears.--he was very uneasy; and but for the sense\\nof his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm\\nevery night of his life.\", 'the strength, resolution, and presence\\nof mind of the mr. knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.', 'while either of them protected him and his, hartfield was safe.--\\nbut mr. john knightley must be in london again by the end of the\\nfirst week in november.', 'the result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\\ncheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at\\nthe moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and mr. elton was\\ncalled on, within a month from the marriage of mr. and mrs. robert\\nmartin, to join the hands of mr. knightley and miss woodhouse.', 'the wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties\\nhave no taste for finery or parade; and mrs. elton, from the\\nparticulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,\\nand very inferior to her own.--\"very little white satin, very few\\nlace veils; a most pitiful business!--selina would stare when she\\nheard of it.\"', '--but, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,\\nthe hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band\\nof true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered\\nin the perfect happiness of the union.']\n"
