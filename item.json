These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \"bots\" for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the ", " of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.\n", "The pages being scraped may embrace ", " or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets.

Some can directly extract data from APIs, while others are capable of handling websites with AJAX-based dynamic content loading or login requirements.
